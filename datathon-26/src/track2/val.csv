8922,FED'S HELLER URGES JAPANESE TO BUY U.S. GOODS,"A member of the Federal Reserve
Board, Robert Heller, said he wanted to see stronger Japanese
demand for American goods.
    ""What I was advocating here was more Japanese purchases of
American goods,"" Heller said in response to a question about the
dollar's weakness in currency markets.
    He told a Heritage Foundation forum, ""I'd be very happy to
see that.""
    In his formal remarks, Heller said he supported the idea of
using commodity prices as an indicator for monetary policy.
    Asked if he would raise the issue at the next Federal Open
Market Committee meeting, he said, ""Even at previous meetings
commodity prices were raised.""
    He added, ""I would not expect future meetings to be
different from past meetings in that respect.""

Industrie &lt;AINP.PA> consortium's planned A340 long-range jets,
with an option on a further 10 A330 medium-range jets, in a
deal worth more than 2.5 billion dlrs, Airbus said in a
statement.
    The contract gives Airbus its first launch customer in the
lucrative U.S. Market for its long-range jet programme.
    Last month Airbus announced it had a total of 104
commitments from nine customers for the planes. A spokeswoman
confirmed today's order was in addition to those commitments.
    Airbus has been competing with McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD>
in the long-range jet market since the U.S. Group formally
launched its MD-11 plane program at the end of 1986. McDonnell
Douglas has won over 100 orders and options for the aircraft.
    The Northwest order comes after the airline ordered 10
short-range A320 Airbus jets, with options on a further 90,
last October, giving Airbus a foothold in the U.S. Market.
    European governments, asked to fund 2.5 to three billion

    The officials said Mitsubishi's decision to move its

40.4 mln dlrs, or 1.39 dlrs per share, that it took in 1986 was
mainly due to its investment in Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP>.
     The company reported an operating profit of 33.0 mln dlrs,
or 32 cts per share, for fiscal 1986, compared to an operating
loss of 9,055,000 dlrs, or 1.23 dlrs per share, in the previous
year.
     Hudson's Bay holds about four mln shares of Dome's 10 pct
series one cumulative subordinate convertible preferred shares.
    Last March, Dome suspended payment of dividends on all
preferred shares until June 1, 1987. The shares give the holder
the right to convert to Dome common shares at 3.33 dlrs per
share.
    Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome common
reaches 3.885 dlrs per share. Dome is trading at 1.12 dlrs per
share, down one ct, today on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
    Hudson's Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retail
operating profit to 185.3 mln dlrs from 111.4 mln dlrs, but
that was partially offset by an increase of 14.9 mln dlrs in
interest costs and 25.3 mln dlrs in taxes.
     Hudson's Bay also said its Markborough properties
subsidiary had an operating profit of 108.6 mln dlrs, up from
98.8 mln dlrs the year before.
    Profit from non-Markborough real estate was 23.5 mln dlrs
in 1986, down from 27.6 mln dlrs a year ago.
    Operating profit from natural resources was 4.2 mln dlrs,
up 1.2 mln dlrs from the prior year. Pensions costs were
reduced by 34.9 mln dlrs due to an accounting change. Total
debt declined during the year by 251 mln dlrs to 2.28 billion

creditor bank demands.
    ""If Argentina had the same difficulties in being unable to
refinance (its debt) under the desired (creditor) conditions,
that (Brasil's) is a path to take,"" Machinea said.
    Brasil last month suspended payments on a large part of its
109-billion dlr debt, the highest in the developing world.
    Machinea said Brasil did not suspend payments because it
wanted to but because it lacked reserves.
    Argentina has since last month been negotiating a 2.15

country's labour troubles showed no signs of easing.
    A national seamen's strike which began on February 27 is
still continuing, despite a partial return to work.
    A spokesman at the bankworkers' national strike
headquarters in Sao Paulo, Lucio Cesar Pires, told Reuters that
about 500,000 of Brazil's 700,000 bankworkers were on strike.

Brazil's labour force, are striking for a 110 pct pay rise.
    Pires said the strike had closed the state-controlled Banco

    Brazil's current labour troubles stems from the collapse of
the government's price freeze and the return of high inflation.

    Under the plan, Chapman will exchange securities and cash

2000 and will sell a controlling interest to Troon Partners
Ltd.
   The agreement with Troon requires Troon to advance 6.5 mln

Troon to tender 100,000 principal amount of debentures to

    The plan also contemplates establishing a restructured loan
providing for one master credit agreement having an aggregate
balance of 22.4 mln dlrs.
    The plan also contemplates the recapitalization of
preferred stock whereby each share will be converted into three

settlement of certain litigation.

more banks will follow Citicorp &lt;CCI> and Chase Manhattan &lt;CMB>

    Seidman, speaking to an American Bankers Association trade
conference, said he did not think regulators would play as big
a role in encouraging banks to build up their loan-loss
reserves as the marketplace would.
   
    My guess is that we as regulators won't become the key
factor. I think the market system will get most of the other
banks to follow suit,"" Seidman told some 3,000 executives

dlrs and Chase Manhattan, 1.6 billion dlrs, to their loan-loss
reserves.

to move forward on the same type of reserving because, if they
don't, their future earnings will be penalized as they hold up
their reserves on a quarter-by-quarter basis,"" Seidman said.
    He said Chase and Citibank, by setting aside huge amounts
at one time,  have put their losses behind them and will show
much better future earnings.

4625,U.S. OFFICIALS DISAGREE ON REDUCING BUDGET DEFICIT,"Senior U.S. Economic officials
disagree on the likelihood the government can meet its budget
deficit reduction targets.
    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, reiterated the Reagan Administration's opposition to
a tax increase and its pledge to reduce the deficit by cutting
spending and fostering economic growth.
    By contrast, Rudolph Penner, Director of the Congressional
Budget Office, said the budget process has broken down and the
deficit will remain close to 200 billion dlrs for fiscal 1987.
    Sprinkel told a symposium sponsored by New York University
that spending could be cut by avoiding decisions based on the
desire to influence votes and by shifting the responsibility
for local projects to state governments.
    He also suggested a line-item veto, which allows the
President to veto parts of bill without rejecting all of it, to
limit wasteful spending. Spending and taxing decisions should
be linked more closely.
    Sprinkel said the Administration still looks for 2.7 pct
growth in U.S. Real gross national product (GNP) in 1987 and
3.5 pct in 1988.
    Asked if the latest economic reports signal this rate of
economic growth is attainable, Sprinkel said, ""It looks pretty
good to me. We've had two very strong employment reports.""
    He also said federal reserve policy is appropriate, adding,
""It looks like they're on track.""
    While further reductions are needed in the trade deficit,
Sprinkel said the lower dollar is having an impact.
    The new 1987 tax laws will not hurt the economy and the tax
reform act of 1986 significantly lowers tax rates and will
greatly increase private production incentives, he said.
    ""Our estimates at the Council of Economic Advisers suggest
national net output of goods and services will permanently
increase by approximately two pct because of the long-run
consequences of tax reform,"" Sprinkel said. ""In 1986, this would
have amounted to an increase of approximately 600 dlrs in the
income of the average American family.""
    Sprinkel also argued the 1981 tax cuts were not responsible
for the large increase in the budget deficit.
    In fiscal 1986 ending September, federal spending amounted
to 23.8 pct of GNP, while federal receipts absorbed 18.5 pct of
GNP, leaving a deficit of 5.3 pct, he said.
    Sprinkel said that, compared with fiscal 1978, the 1986
federal expenditure share of GNP is 2.7 percentage points
higher and the revenue share of GNP is virtually the same.
    ""Contrary to the conventional wisdom, therefore, the 1981
tax cut is not the root cause of the extraordinary budget
deficits of the past few years,"" Sprinkel said.
    ""This tax cut merely rolled back the inflation-induced tax
increases that occurred between 1978 and 1981,"" he added.
    However, the Congressional Budget Office's Rudolph Penner
argued that the tax cut in 1981 was misguided.
    ""Since making the big mistake in 1981 of cutting taxes
enormously without any plan to decrease spending by the
Administration or Congress, indeed with increases in defence
spending, now all the options (for reducing the budget deficit)
are unpleasant,"" he said.
    Penner said the tax cut resulted from the ideological
turmoil in the U.S. Caused by the ""biggest sustained inflation
in our nation's history,"" which helped foster widespread
distrust of government.
    ""The American people turned on the government with tax
revolt at the state level and new demands on the government at
the national level,"" Penner said.
    ""But their dislike of taxes exceeded their general dislike
of spending programs. Now the correction of that 1981 mistake
demands that the system change a lot.""
    Penner sees little hope the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget
deficit reduction targets will be met and said the deficit will
remain at roughly 200 billion dlrs this year.
    He said a budget process that sets targets arbitrarily is
not likely to succeed.
    ""I feel pretty safe in saying that any process that tries to
dictate a numerical outcome from above is doomed to fail simply
because there's no ... Way to enforce it,"" Penner said.
    Penner questioned the methods by which the 1987 budget
deficit was cut. He said 18 to 19 billion dlrs were eliminated
by one-time measures, such as a temporary increase in taxes
related to tax reform and sales of government assets.
    ""Another four billion dlrs was cut by what I call creative
timing changes, like moving the military payday from the last
day of fiscal 1987 to the first day of fiscal 1988. That saved
more than two billion dlrs,"" Penner said.

    TWA has offered 52 dlrs per share for USAir Group. USAir
rejected the offer yesterday, calling it a last-minute attempt
to interfere with its takeover of Piedmont Aviation Inc.
    A TWA spokesman said the company has filed an application
for approval on its offer to buy USAir with the Department of
Transportation, and later today it will file a response to
USAir's motion with the DOT to dismiss the TWA application.
    TWA said it made the statement today on its stock position

    USAir stock was trading at 50-3/4, up 2-1/4 on heavy volume
of 3.1 mln shares. TWA stock fell 3/8 to 30-5/8.
    While analysts and arbitragers have speculated that Icahn
may have made the offer for USAir in order to trigger the
acquisition of his own airline, Wall Street today began to take
Icahn's effort more seriously.
    ""I think he's going to be the next Frank Lorenzo of Wall
Street,"" said one market source. Lorenzo, chairman of Texas
Air, has added to his airline with the acquisitions of Eastern

    There was also speculation that Icahn would like to buy

5759,"DEBT PROGNOSIS AGREED, BUT NO CURE IN SIGHT","Latin America urgently needs more money
if it is to grow its way out of its deepening debt crisis, but
fresh ideas about how to stimulate new lending quickly seem to
be in short supply.
    Bankers, officials and academics at a conference organized
by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology stressed the
importance of proper economic policies and increased private
investment. But they offered no glimpse of a grand design to
banish the specter of a widespread repudiation of the region's
380 billion dlr debt. ""Such a solution is still not in sight,""
said Nobel Prize-winning economist Franco Modigliani.
    The conference was held against the background of the
recent suspension of interest payments by Brazil and Ecuador,
but it was Argentine finance secretary Mario Brodersohn who
spelled out most clearly the social and economic strains caused
by the need to service billions of dlrs of debt.
    Brodersohn, who is negotiating currently with foreign banks
for a 2.15 billion dlr loan for 1987, says Argentina will have
to grow at a four pct annual rate between now and 1992 simply
to restore per capita income to the level of 1975.
    He said the investment needed to fuel this growth can come
partly from structural economic reforms at home, but this alone
will not be enough.
    ""We have to reduce the transfer of resources,"" Brodersohn
said, adding that mounting economic strains in Latin America
make this a matter of urgency.
    Brodersohn and other Latin officials, however, did not
spell out how this should be achieved.
    The creditors' strategy, spelled out by U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker in October 1985, is to spur additional
lending by private banks and multilateral development banks in
return for economic reforms.
    But there was a widespread recognition at the conference
that the Baker Plan has fallen well short of expectations.
    Miguel Urrutia, a senior official of the Inter-American
Development Bank, for instance, said IADB lending had actually
declined in 1986 and had started slowly in 1987.
    Mexico is due to sign a 7.7 billion dlr loan on Friday that
will be the first major facility under the Baker Plan, which
called for net new bank lending between 1986 and 1988, a target
that Morris Goldstein of the International Monetary Fund said
is now optimistic.
    Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American
Affairs Paul Taylor acknowledged that the Baker Plan ""has not
yet succeeded as well as we hoped.""
    But if the debtors at the conference were hoping to hear an
official commitment to try a new tack, they must have been
disappoiunted.
    Ted Truman, director of the International Finance Diviision
at the Federal Reserve Board, said banks were short-sighted in
not lending promptly and in the amounts called for by Baker.
    He said some streamlining of the lending process may be
needed, but added, ""I see no alterantive to the present course
of responsible cooperation.""
    A major theme at the conference, however, was that the
world economy might not continue to cooperate while the debtors
and creditors muddle along. If export markets dry up because of
recession or protectionism, speakers warned, Latin America will
be even more hard-pressed to service its debts.
    Rimmer de Vries, chief international economist at Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co, said he was very concerned that world
economic growth of three to 3-1/2 pct cannot be sustained and
that West Germany and Japan wowuld not take up the slack in the
world economy that will arise as the U.S. narrows its trade
deficit.
    ""There's a deflationary force coming down the mountain, and
I don't know who's going to be rolled over,"" de Vries said. He
called for a new lending initiative with a wide menu of options
as alternatives to pure new money.
    ""Can we not manage this lending a bit more imaginatively?""
he asked the conference.
    But new ideas take time to devise and implement, and
Brazil's suspension of interest payments shows that the
aptience of debtors might be wearing thin.
    Persio Arida, a former director of the Brazizlian central
bank who was a key architect of that country's Cruzado plan to
curb inflation, said there is an ""incentive problem"" throughout
Latin America.

one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International
Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements
Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
    Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
    The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal
Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that
purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.
    Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom
management which is competing with Redstone for control of the
company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.
    The company did not disclose the details of the revised
offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
them later today.
    The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,
and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
at least half of the outstanding stock.
    The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided
they keep the information secret.
    In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of
completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of
America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
    Besides the financing it would raise through a bank
syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a
separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
Redstone said.
    Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased
its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.
    Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
    The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares
and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
    The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has
proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
    Last week, the management group submitted what it called
its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's
previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

16856,YEUTTER SAYS JAPANESE CURB ALL BUT CERTAIN,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go
ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.
    Asked in a television interview what the chance was for
Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese
electronic exports, he said ""slim to none.""
    Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to
retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end
dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than
cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.
    Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United States
did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.
    He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials
they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take
time to monitor any compliance.
    Asked how long that would take, he said ""We want to see a
pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would
take a few weeks.""
    Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods
because the items selected are also readily available from
other countries and manufacturers.
    He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.
    ""It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that
full well,"" Yeutter said.
    He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but ""that's more of a
paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any
adverse impact on U.S. trade.""
    Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor
issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit
later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
    He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a
major issue, would be productive but ""I don't see any practical
way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his
visit.""

14832,THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER,"Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5
billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a
year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
    It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
and semi-finished products.
    The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
first quarter due to lower oil prices.
    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
billion baht from 56.6 billion.
    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up
64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.

7710,BANK OF FINLAND TO TRADE IN BANKS' CERTIFICATES,"The Bank of Finland said it has
started dealings in banks' certificates of deposits (CDs) with
immediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its own
paper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market.
    Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news
conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money
market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit
amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling.
    ""The recent introduction of three-month money and these new
regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market
and the discount rate as monetary instruments,"" Kullberg said.
    Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these
were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank
of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs,
they said.
    ""The central bank for the first time has an instrument with
which it really can influence the price of money in this
country,"" one banker said.
    Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits
to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital
and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now
introduced if the limit is exceeded.
    Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetary
department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy
on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs.
    ""We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the
first, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we
will issue at least a few times a week,"" Korkman told Reuters.
    He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a
three-month maturity at first as the market was best developed
for paper of that maturity.
    The Bank of Finland introduced last December three-month
credits and deposits at rates determined by the central bank
and the commercial banks as a shift away from the traditional
overnight call money market.
    Liquidity on the call credit market has fallen from around
nine billion markka in early December to 167 mln last week,
while three-month credits have risen to three to four billion.
    On the interbank market there has been an increasing trade
in banks' CDs, estimated to be some eight billion markka. In
addition, commercial paper accounts for around five billion
markka and Treasury Bills two billion.

11215,BROKERS SAY TOKYO STOCKS WILL RESUME RISE,"The Tokyo stock market is likely to
recover from its recent nervousness, caused by the rise of the
yen and the threat of a trade war with the U.S., And resume its
upward climb, brokers polled by Reuters said.
    President Reagan's threat to impose tariffs on Japanese
electronics exports because of Japan's alleged refusal to abide
by a bilateral agreement on computer chips, was unlikely to
cause the market to crash, the brokers said on the eve of the
new fiscal year starting April 1.
    The market today fell 60.91 points to 21,566.66.
    Most brokers said Tokyo stocks should rise 10 to 15 pct in
the coming fiscal year, provided the yen does not rise too far
against the dollar and U.S. Sanctions do not escalate into an
all-out trade war.
    ""The market will continue to rise in the new fiscal year, so
long as we can avoid a free-fall in the dollar against the yen,""
Nikko Securities' top analyst Kasuhiza Okamoto said.
    However, brokers said the market was unlikely to perform
better than it has in the past year.
    ""It will be very difficult to repeat last year's
performance. Last year was a bumper year that will live in the
annals of the market,"" said Kleinwort and Benson Ltd's
securities analyst, Peter Tasker.
    The market rose 37 pct in the fiscal year just ending.
    Tasker said Japan's discount rate, which was cut five times
this past fiscal year, was so low that it forced funds from
bank accounts into stocks, buoying the market.
    Nomura Securities Company brokers said that in the coming
year the discount rate would probably be cut only once or twice
and the inflow of funds would be slower.
    Brokers said their optimism about the market was based on
the current low interest rates, the increasing propensity of
the Japanese to save as the economy stagnates, the imminent
introduction of taxes on traditionally untaxed post office
savings and the allure of quick and easy profits from stocks.
    They said Japanese with money to spare, and companies
unwilling to invest in real plant and machinery in the present
climate of stagnant growth, would keep on snapping up stocks.
    ""You just have to jump on the back of the winners and jump
off quick if they start to lose,"" one broker said.
    Currently the Japanese discount rate is 2.5 pct.
    Brokers predicted that among this year's winners would be
shares which will benefit from domestic expansion.
    Other winners would be stocks related to the fight against
AIDS, financial stocks in general, food shares likely to gain
from a government-initiated agricultural deregulation
programme, and issues supported by Japan's increased defense
spending budget.
    ""The themes this year are very clear,"" said Nikko Securities'
Okamoto. He said Japan had to respond to international pressure
to stimulate its domestic demand, buy more imports and
establish itself as a supply base of capital.
    Brokers said banks and other financial institutions would
be among the most popular shares this year.
    ""We will have to consolidate our position as the capital
supply base to the world,"" said Okamoto, noting Japan is the
world's largest creditor nation.
    Brokers said they expect the government this year to permit
Japanese banks to start full-scale equity brokerage overseas.
They also expect it to relax financial practice laws in Japan.
    Brokers said they expect subsidies to Japan's farmers to be
slashed this year, cutting the price of food. Beneficiaries of
such a move would include food processors and suppliers.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has set the expansion of
domestic demand as a top priority this year, and brokers said
they envisaged higher profits for real estate and construction
companies, as well as many domestic manufacturers.
    Brokers denied a suggestion that the market might be
over-extended because the amount now invested, 334,000 billion
yen, was about the same as Japan's gross national product.
    Barclays De Zoette and Wedd financial analyst, Peter
Morgan, said the 20 pct tax on post office and bank deposits
due to be levied this autumn would channel at least 2,000
billion more yen into the stock market.
    Brokers said they believe there would be more reports in
the coming year of scientific discoveries to combat or diagnose
Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and these would
propel related companies' shares even higher than they had
risen already.
    ""AIDS stories suck individuals' money into the market.
Japanese people are paranoid about AIDS,"" said one broker.

    Canada and the EC told a GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade) council meeting that the fee, which imposes a tax on
an ad valorem basis on imports as of December 1, 1986, is
illegal under GATT rules.
    U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels said the fee, imposed by
the U.S. To help cover customs expenditure as part of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, does
not breach GATT rules and is similar to fees charged by many
other countries.
    Samuels suggested that a working party be set up to examine
the dispute, instead of a panel empowered to rule on it.

would forestall any attempt to negotiate liberalisation of

approved a general wage increase in the form of bonuses ranging
from 20 to 30 pct and a 120-day price freeze on a basket of
basic consumer goods.
    Both measures, which take effect on May 1, were approved by
the cabinet. They will be announced to the nation by Lusinchi
in a televised address tonight but the text of the decrees was
released this afternoon.
    Businessmen, who met Lusinchi, opposed the pay rise, saying
it will fuel inflation. The inflation rate was 11.5 pct in 1986
and private economists say it will be 25 to 30 pct in 1987.
    The central bank said first quarter inflation was 6.3 pct.
    The wage increase for public and private sector employees
will be 30 pct on salaries of up to 2,100 bolivars a month. For
salaries of from 2,101 to 6,100 bolivars 25 pct and for those
of 6,101 to 20,000 bolivars 20 pct.
    The measures were taken in response to a request from the
Venezuelan confederation CTV for an increase to offset the loss
in the purchasing power of workers' salaries. It estimated the
loss at 40 pct.
    The general wage rise is the third granted by Lusinchi
since his government took office in February 1984.
    The wage increases are a bonus and will not be considered
in calculating benefits or severance pay, the decree said.
    At the same time, Lusinchi declared a freeze on lay-offs
and firings for the next 120 days.
    The price freeze applies to a group of 120 foods and other
consumer goods declared to be ""of primary necessity.""
    It does not apply to prices charged by agricultural
producers or to goods for which the price is falling.
    The decree establishes fines of between 1,000 and 500,000
bolivars for merchants who violate the price control measure.

20060,"EAST, WEST APPROVE NUCLEAR FUSION ENERGY PROJECT","East and West on Monday decided to go
ahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed as
possibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said.
    Representatives of the U.S., The Soviet Union, the European
Community and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionary
thermonuclear reactor, to produce energy not from splitting
atoms as in today's nuclear plants, but by joining them.
    Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for Plasma
Physics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich, West Germany,
and is scheduled for completion by 1990, an IAEA statement
said.
    Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has been
under way for many years but the project approved on Monday,
known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor
(ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built.
    The project represents an unprecedented display of
East-West scientific cooperation, but a decision will not be
made until its completion on whether an actual reactor would be
jointly constructed or by individual participant countries.
    Dieter Sigmar, a leading U.S. Fusion researcher, said last
month that the development of a demonstration plant would cost
several billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years.
    Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste.
    While today's nuclear power plants need uranium, mined in
only a few countries and producing dangerous waste, fusion
plants would eventually run only on deuterium, an element
related to hydrogen and available from almost limitless

11681,FDIC OFFERS RISKED-BASED CAPITAL RULE FOR BANKS,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
proposed for comment a rule setting minimum capital
requirements for banks based on assessment of the risks of
their assets.
    The proposed rule, if adopted, would carry out a
U.S.-British agreement announced in January for a uniform
system to gauge the capital banks must maintain that accounts
for the riskiness of loans and other assets.
    The regulatory agency's staff said at a meeting the
proposal was in line with those of the Federal Reserve Board
and the Comptroller of the Currency.
    The three U.S. agencies and the Bank of England agreed in
early January on the outlines of a uniform system for capital
standards designed for the increasingly international banking
industry that operates beyond national boundaries.
    The FDIC, which regulates state-chartered banks, sought
public comment for 60 days, after which it will adopt a rule to
conform with those of the Fed and the Comptroller.
    The FDIC said the proposal rule redefines primary capital,
assigns risk weights to assets not kept on a bank's balance
sheet, and lays the groundwork for establishing a minimum
risk-based capital ratio.

strike against Iowa Beef Processors Inc Dakota City, Nebraska,
plant, effective Tuesday.
    The company submitted their latest offer to the union at

    Members unanimously rejected the latest company offer that

    Zack said the company's offer for a cut in wages was
unacceptable and said IBP was refusing to bargain in good

    IBP's latest offer included wage cuts of 60 cents an hour
for slaughter operations and a 45 cents an hour cut in pay for
processing workers. The cut follows the 1.07 dlr cut in pay
workers received in 1982 and the wage freeze that has lasted

    The offer also eliminated overtime after eight hours

11459,TRADERS CUT BAHIA TEMPORAO COCOA CROP ESTIMATE,"Trade estimates of the coming
May/September temporao harvest in Brazil's main cocoa growing
state of Bahia are now in the 1.5 mln to 2.0 mln 60-kilo bag
range against 2.0 mln to 2.5 mln two weeks ago.
    Traders in the state capital Salvador told Reuters the
effects of a dry period in the first six weeks of the year had
been harsher than thought earlier.
    Although good flowering had followed the onset of rains in
mid-February subsequent pod setting was dissappointing.
    Last year's temporao, also hit by a dry spell, was 2.77 mln
bags. In 1984 severe drought cut the crop to 1.79 mln bags.
    The traders said another factor leading to lower crop
predictions is that many farmers are not caring properly for
plantations because of low returns on their investment.
    Manpower, fertiliser and other costs have been cut back as
farmers feel the pinch of the rise in interest rates over the
past six months coupled with low bean prices.
    If such economies continue into the winter months both the
temporao and the developing October/April main crop could face
serious damage from pod rot attacks on trees which would
normally be treated against the disease.
    Recent very wet weather has already caused some isolated
incidences of pod rot but reports from the growing regions say
these are not yet significant.
    The traders said they expect very low deliveries of
temporao beans in the first three months of the harvest and the
bulk will not appear until the last month, September.
    Despite the low loads, trees are said to be in excellent
condition and recent flowering and pod setting - which will
lead to late temporao/early main crop beans - has been good.

16072,U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE,"Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial
markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's
wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that
is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.
    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline
as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell
sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.
    But that confidence is now cracking as the financial
markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's
often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.
    ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar
freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" said
David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in
40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington
failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a
credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short
of further depreciation of the dollar.
    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid
worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare
away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.
    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12
dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike
in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
by 33 points to 2339.
    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the
markets' instability frightening. He believes economic
fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""once
you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.""
    ""There's a stark possibility that you could get a
destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates
and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.""
    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics
in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the
controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and
264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.
    ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But
the agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters.
    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this
year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it
would take very little to touch off what he calls the second
phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the
dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.
    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on
March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.
    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with
historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are
not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its
decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.
    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest
weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks
suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling
below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as
part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.
    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of
confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced
plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic
imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.
    Many economists believe that long-run stability will not
return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is
addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the
massive budget deficit.
    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of
central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no
choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.
    ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a
substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding
cut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones.
    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest
rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for
American farmers, Latin American governments and others.
    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and
Co, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak
against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar
weakness,"" he said.
    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being
made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.
    ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the
budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody
cares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69
will have been greater.
    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and
thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.
    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that
a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put on
your helmets,"" Giordano said.

6285,BRAZILIAN PLANNING MINISTER RESIGNS,"Brazilian Planning Minister Joao Sayad
resigned, a presidential spokesman said.
    His resignation was accepted during a meeting with 
President Jose Sarney this afternoon, the spokesman said.
    No official reasons for the resignation were immediately
available, but sources close to the government said Sayad had
pressed for a three-month price freeze and sharp government
spending cuts to combat inflation.
    Neither Sarney nor Finance Minister Dilson Funaro accepted
the proposals, the sources said.
    Sayad was one of the architects of last year's ""Plano
Cruzado"" program, which froze prices, ended widespread
indexation of the economy and introduced the new cruzado
currency to replace the cruzeiro in a bid to cut the 250 pct
annual inflation rate.
    After holding prices for nearly nine months, the plan was
unable to withstand the inflationary pressures of booming
consumer demand and widespread shortages. In the first two
months of this year prices rose by around 30 per cent.
    A sharp deterioration in Brazil's foreign trade surplus
caused President Sarney to announce last month the suspension
of interest rate payments on 68 billion dollars of commercial
debt.
    Finance Minister Funaro told reporters last week new
measures to correct the economy would be announced within a
month, although he gave no further details.
    Earlier today U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said 
Brazil should come up with a new economic plan if it hopes to
get additional assistance from commercial banks and others.
    Sayad's resignation might foreshadow other changes in the
Brazilian cabinet.
    Presidential spokesman Frota Netto told journalists earlier
today the government was considering a suggestion by the Chief
of Civilian Staff at the Presidency Marco Maciel that a new
multi-party cabinet be formed to deal with the country's

827,"KIDDER UNIT SELLS CMOS, INCLUDING FLOATERS","Kidder, Peabody Mortgage Assets Trust
Five, a unit of Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, is offering 500 mln
dlrs of collateralized mortgage obligations in seven classes,
including floating-rate and inverse-rate tranches.
    Sole manager Kidder Peabody said the first floating-rate
class has an initial rate of 6.755 pct that will be reset
quarterly at 40 basis points over three-month LIBOR, with an 11
pct cap.
    Totaling 53.3 mln dlrs, this floating-rate class contains a
so-called catchup provision that allows investors to recapture
possible lost interest, according to Kidder Peabody.
    For instance, if three-month LIBOR rises to 15 pct during
the life of the floating-rate tranche and falls back below the
11 pct cap, investors would be paid back, dollar for dollar,
the amount of interest they would have received if the CMOs did
not carry a maximum interest rate, a Kidder officer said.
    Kidder Peabody introduced this concept on February 12.
    The other floating-rate class totals 132.4 mln dlrs and has
an initial rate of 6.975 pct that will be reset quarterly at 60
basis points over three-month LIBOR, with a 13 pct cap. This
tranche does not have a catch-up provision, the Kidder officer
said.
    The inverse-rate tranche totals 71.3 mln dlrs and has an
initial rate of 10.903 pct. The rate will be reset quarterly
according to the formula of 22.44027 minus the product of
1.8097 times three-month LIBOR.
    Yields on the remaining fixed-rate CMOs, the balance of the
500 mln dlr issue, range from 7-1/4 to 9.27 pct, or 90 to 160
basis points over comparable Treasuries.
    The issue is rated a top-flight AAA by Standard and Poor's.

14956,NO SPECIAL CHECKS AT GERMAN BANKS BECAUSE OF VW,"Banking supervisory authorities are
not carrying out any special checks at banks in the wake of the
currency fraud scandal at Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, a spokesman
for the Hesse regional state central bank, LZB, said.
    But inspectors are paying particular attention to foreign
exchange matters in their routine checks at banks, he said in
answer to enquiries. There is no evidence rules were broken.
    The LZB spokesman was commenting on press reports that
banks had ""parked"" open currency positions for short periods with
VW to circumvent regulations limiting the size of open currency
positions that can be carried by banks overnight.
    The press allegations emerged after VW said it may have
lost 480 mln marks as a result of a possible currency fraud.
    LZBs are regional branches of the Bundesbank. Their
inspectors also act for the Federal Banking Supervisory Office
in West Berlin, which regulates banking in West Germany.
    Following the 1974 Herstatt bank crash on currency
speculation, West Germany limited a bank's total open positions
overnight to 30 pct of shareholders' equity and reserves.
    German press reports have said some banks circumvented this
rule by selling excess positions to VW, then repurchasing them.
    The banking regulations only cover banks. Company foreign
exchange activities are not subject to the banking regulators.
    The LZB spokesman said there were no concrete signs that
the regulations had been broken, and it would be irresponsible
to instigate a special check just on the basis of the reports.
    The LZBs receive monthly balance sheet statistics from
banks in their areas, which they check, and they also routinely
inspect all banks in greater detail over longer periods.
    But LZB officials said it would be hard for inspectors to
detect a breach of these rules as they do not check companies
and therefore would not see both sides of any parking deal.
    ""If the managements of the banks have not spotted them, it
will be even harder for our inspectors,"" said one official.
    It would be up to the public prosecutors to order special
checks on suspicion of breaches of these regulations, they
said. Prosecutors in Brunswick are already investigating the VW
currency scandal, and have ordered the arrest of VW's former
chief foreign exchange dealer.
    Breaches of the Banking Law in this way can be punished by
a 100,000 mark fine for the dealers involved, and in extreme
cases by removal of the managers if their active involvement is
proved.

2132,FINNISH TAXATION MAJOR ISSUE IN ELECTION CAMPAIGN,"Personal taxation has emerged as the
major economic issue in Finnish general elections later this
month, and Conservative gains could mark a shift towards
indirect taxation and accelerate moves towards more
market-oriented banking practices, economists say.
    Opinion polls indicate the Conservative Party, Finland's
second largest, may gain enough clout after the elections to
join a coalition government which is still likely to be
dominated by the Social Democrats of Prime Minister Kalevi
Sorsa.
    But the economists point out that Conservative economic
policies differ only slightly from the governments', and that
trade with the Soviet Union will not be affected.
    Helsinki bankers said a new government, including the
Conservatives for the first time in 20 years, could bring about
a shift from direct to indirect taxation.
    The present coalition of Social democrats and Centrists has
embarked on a tax reform programme to cut marginal taxation,
which is up to 75 pct in the highest income scales. The
opposition has also called for reforms, but they differ over
how to regain lost state revenues.
    One Conservative favoured possibility is abolishing tax
exemption on interest from bank deposits and government bonds.
    Hannu Halttunen, of Helsinki bank Kansallis-Osake-Pankki
(KOP), told Reuters ""We want to be more free in setting interest
rates and in creating different deposits to suit the individual
investors. If tax on interest is introduced, then we prefer a
system with taxation of real interest gains.""
    Under present laws, bank customers are exempted from tax on
interest when banks jointly set interest rates. Bankers said
this had encouraged cartel-style banking and was hindering
tougher inter-bank competition.
    A London-based Nordic banking expert said liberalisation
was too strong a word to use in a Finnish context, but a
Conservative presence could dislodge traditional practices.
    ""It would probably result in new practices that have been
seen elsewhere for a few years growing rather more quickly in
Finland,"" he said, in a reference to money market instruments.
    All parties, especially the Conservatives, have been
careful to avoid making Finnish-Soviet trade an election issue.
Moscow is Finland's largest trading partner. Until a few years
ago the Conservative Party was seen as anti-communist, but has
now moderated its stance, political analysts say.
    Trade between Helsinki and Moscow is based on a barter
system, and is balanced under long-term accords.
    In January the two countries signed a 1987 agreement worth
30 billion markka, but trade in the past two years has been
declining due to the fall in the price of crude oil, which
accounts for 80 pct of Finnish imports from the Soviet Union.
    The bankers said taxation had become the major economic
theme of the campaign because there were few other issues.
    Inflation was 3.4 pct in 1986, compared with 5.9 pct in
1985, and unemployment has increased slightly from 6.1 pct of
the workforce in 1985 to last year's levels of 6.7 pct.
    The Social democrats in 1986 doubled the country's foreign
trade surplus compared with 1985, from 2.50 billion markka to
5.04 billion markka.
    Opinion polls say Sorsa's Social Democrats will remain the
largest party in the 200-seat Parliament, with some 26 pct of
the vote. They currently hold 57 seats.
    The Centre Party, the other major coalition partner, is
also expected to hold on to its 37 seats.
    But increased Conservative support and a decline for the
Communists could make force Sorsa to allow the Conservatives
into government. They currently hold 44 seats.

9406,U.S. SENATE PANEL APPROVES TRADE MISSION BILL,"The U.S. Senate Agriculture
Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and
aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation,
credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.
    The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade
missions made up of representatives of the Departments of
Agriculture and State, the Agency for International
Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, market
development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.
    At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year
after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S.
programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, Export
Enhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, and
export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103).
    The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill,
offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would have
required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one
mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.
    Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnes
of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food
donation program.
    The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed
increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up
to 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said.
    The committee also dropped a provision identifying which
countries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities.
    Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries ""friendly
to the United States"" would be eligible to host the trade
missions.
    Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico,
the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru,
Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela,
Tunisia and Morocco.
    The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural

4441,U.S. FARM CREDIT LOSS PUT AT 900 MLN IN 1ST HALF,"A member of the board which
regulates the Farm Credit System predicted the troubled farm
lender may lose about 900 mln dlrs in the first half of 1987,
hastening the need for a federal rescue this year.
    Speaking to the House subcommittee responsible for farm
credit issues, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) board member
Jim Billington said ""My recommendation is that legislation
(aiding the system) must be moved prior to June, 30, 1987, or
it will be difficult to close the (farm credit system) books.""
    Billington's loss prediction is gloomier than either the
system or its regulator had previously admitted.
    The system itself has so far predicted losses for all of
1987 will reach only 1.1 billion dlrs, down from 1.9 billion in
1986 and 2.7 billion in 1985.
    However, Billington said the system is losing in excess of
400 mln dlrs per quarter, implying total losses for 1987 of
more than 1.6 billion.
    Losses of that magnitude would exhaust the 1.4 billion dlrs
in capital surplus the system held at the end of 1986.
    The system also has 4.2 billion dlrs in capital held by its
member borrowers, called borrower stock, which theoretically
could be used as capital.
    Billington said by the end of 1987, more than 1.6 billion
dlrs of the 4.2 billion in borrower stock would be downgraded
in value because of the mounting losses.
    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, urged that
Congress begin to consider legislation rescuing the system by
Easter and that a bill be completed by the fall.
    Chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Ed Jones,
(D-Tenn.) said today ""the time has arrived to consider
assistance to save the system.""
    The Senate Democratic leadership indicated last month that
it would begin drafting a bailout bill by Easter.
    FCA board members differed on whether a direct government
infusion of cash will be needed to rescue the system.
    FCA chairman Naylor said a federal guarantee of both
borrower stock and system bonds held by investors might avoid
the need to provide ""hard capital"" to the system.
    However, Billington said ""its not really that simple, in my
opinion,"" adding that government funds may be needed to rescue
the system.
    Neither regulator estimated how much money might be needed.

15539,BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE,"The Bundesbank sees no current reason
to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers
said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may once again be under discussion.
    Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his
two central bank council colleagues.
    But he added that the last central bank council meeting on
April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of
""subdued optimism,"" particularly influenced by the news brought
by several state central bank presidents.
    ""Much is going better than the impression gained by the
public from the January figures, which have been in the
meantime superseded,"" he said.
    German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a
decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9
pct after they had been unchanged in December.
    Bank economists said that the two together showed the
economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter
of 1987.
    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a
steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark
rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto
Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF
meeting.
    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates
on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase
tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, ""Since the central
bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14
days, this is hardly probable.""
    Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved
away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of
targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no
comment on the subject while negotiations were still in
progress in Washington.

10996,TALKING POINT/WALL STREET STOCKS,"Investors who have been riding the
bull market in U.S. stocks got a stinging reminder today of how
unexpected news can trigger sharp reversals.
    ""The market was ripe for some type of pullback,"" said Frank
Korth, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers. He said over the
weekend, investors pondered President Reagan's decision to
impose tariffs on Japanese electronic goods and some concluded
the step could signal the beginning of a trade war.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 79 points in 30
minutes before stabilizing and making a partial recovery.
    Korth believes there has been an over-reaction and
near-term traders might want to step in and buy one-half or
one-quarter of new investments they have been considering.
    ""We're still in a bull market,"" said William Raftery of
Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. He thinks history has shown
such sharp pullbacks are a natural part of bull markets. ""The
bear usually strikes slowly,"" he said.
    Raftery noted that blue chips have been forefront of the
rally that took the market to record highs last week. In
today's decline, he said, the big name stocks were coming more
into a more normal alignment with the general market.
    Charles Comer of Moseley Securities Corp said ultimately
the pullback could prove to be a pre-shock to the long awaited
correction. But for now he believes the bull market remains
intact. However, it could take several weeks for the market to
complete a ""distribution process"" and along the way there will
be rallies.
    Comer thinks it is premature to conclude that today's
action signaled formation of a market top. He thinks the market
can hold in the low to mid 2200 area on the Dow index.
    ""This probably is the correction that has been expected,""
said Crandall Hays of Robert W. Baird Co.
    Hays noted that market breadth began to deteriorate last
week. He said this morning investors saw the dollar down
further, interest rates up and gold up. ""The trade problem got
people spooked and and all the bad things were happening at
once,"" he said.
    ""This correction could take us down 150 points and we're
half-way there now,"" he said early today.
    He thinks the downward move in stock prices could be over
in a couple of weeks. Business conditions seem to be getting
better according to what he hears from a broad cross-section of
companies, from retailers to machinery manufacturers.
    ""The market was high and people were looking for a
correction, so this was an excuse for the market to go down,""
said Alan Ackerman of Gruntal and Co.
    He believes investors will be in a mood of extreme caution
or slightly negative for the near term.
    Ackerman thinks the U.S. is attempting to ""fire a shot
across Japan's bow and let them know we're serious about having
closer trade ties."" But nevertheless investors have been
rattled by ""a perception that a full scale trade war is
possible."" Ultimately, unless there is an accord, the effects
could be higher interest rates and unemployment, he said.
    ""I anticipate a further correction later this week,"" said
Harry Laubscher of Tucker Anthony, R.L. Day. He thinks the
pullback was ""the start of an overdue correction of between six
and 10 pct from the market highs.""
    Although investors now have new reason to worry about
higher interests rate and a return of inflation, Laubscher
says, ""it is not the end of the bull market.""
    ""The market was looking for a reason to knock itself down a
little bit, and with the trade sanctions coming largely as a
surprise, this was the think the market attached itself to,""

17410,NORTH AMERICAN GAS MARKET RECOVERY YEARS AWAY,"Better times for the hard hit
natural gas industry remains two to three years away as a
seemingly intractable supply bubble continues to depress sales
and prices, industry officials said.
    An uncertain regulatory environment, disputes over Canadian
pricing policies and unusually warm winters are working against
a quick recovery in the sector, a number of corporate and
government speakers told an energy conference here.
    ""We see a tough, tough short-term market, both as to price
and volume,"" said Michael Phelps, vice president of &lt;Westcoast
Transmission Co Ltd>, a major Canadian natural gas carrier.
    But Phelps predicted a fall in U.S. supply -- caused by a
sharp drop in exploration -- and a slight demand increase
should help to burn off the excess supply by 1990.
    As a result, Canadian gas exports to the U.S. market should
rise to up to 1.5 trillion cubic feet a year by the end of the
decade, nearly double 1986's total.
    The health of the Canadian industry is heavily dependent on
the U.S. market where nearly one third of Canada's gas
production is sent.
    Cuba Wadlington, a vice president at Northwest Pipeline
Corp of Salt Lake City, shared the view that markets could be
in balance by 1990.
    He said while North American demand for natural gas has
flattened at about 18 trillion cubic feet a year, a return to
more colder winters in the next few years could quickly tighten
supplies.
    ""Things are clearly working towards a shrinking of the
bubble,"" Wadlington told Reuters in an interview.
    However, recent decisions by the U.S. Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) were sharply criticized by
Canadian delegates who suggested the moves could prevent the
country from participating in the market's recovery.
    The key dispute, known as the as billed issue, involves a
ruling last December by FERC which effectively bars U.S.
pipeline companies and consumers from paying certain Canadian
shipping expenses.
    The Canadian government believes the ruling could severely
weaken the country's gas producers. ""Besides the
extra-territorial effect, there is the potential that Conadian
producers and consumers may end up subsidizing the cost of
transportation services originally incurred on behalf of U.S.
customers,"" said Robert Skinner, an assistant deputy minister in
Canada's energy department.
    But FERC Chairman Martha Hesse told the conference the
ruling was really intended ""to assure equal, fair and open
competition in the pricing of natural gas sold within our
country -- whatever the source of the gas.""
    Hesse maintained Canadian gas was crucial to the emergence
of a freely competitive, continent-wide, energy market.
    Speaking to concerns in Canada that the U.S. is seeking to
limit Canadian gas shipments, Hesse said such a move would work
against the long-term interest of American consumers. ""We truly
constitute a North American market,"" she said. ""Natural gas
moving through pipelines recognizes no boundries.""

16564,EC MEAT DIRECTIVE DEADLINE SEEN FLEXIBLE,"U.S. officials said they held out
little hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw a
controversial meat inspection requirement, due to go into
effect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cut
off their exports.
    But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.
plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year
provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.
Agriculture Department.
    The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will
require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC
inspection standards beginning April 30.
    The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting
the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.
    At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln
dlrs in 1985.
    The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes
in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing
to use of wood.
    Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,
one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved
without further review. USDA would have to certify that the
plants had corrected the deficiencies.
    All remaining plants with a history or potential of
shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more
significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before
further EC review.
    Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat
Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal
trade retaliation petition by April 30.
    An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft
petition.
    An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said
U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,
but that ""the chances of that are not too good at this time.""
    However, there is the ""expectation"" in U.S. government and
meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow
shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from
U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring
their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the
USTR official said.

5258,COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS,"The credibility of government efforts to
stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the
test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a
buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government
delegates and trade experts said.
    Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when
International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on
how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many
of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to
agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.
    The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the
International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses
running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting
a shadow over commodity negotiations.
    The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to
compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts
with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear
lines drawn between aid and trade.
    A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic
elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in
Geneva at the weekend.
    Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa
Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with
quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to
be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would
""distort, not support"" the market.
    Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO
for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee
prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can
founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa
futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has
also contributed to the recent slip in prices.
    The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the
""must buy"" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,
which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but
without rules for the operation of the buffer stock.
    Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should
operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement
limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it
cannot operate on futures markets.
    A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost
100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or
selling operations, were carried forward from the previous
agreement.
    Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on
all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.
    The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on
buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be
over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should
pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working
group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative
matters, and the full council meets on Thursday.
    Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds
should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member
countries such as Malaysia.
    Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer
stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate
manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.
    The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked
to the one over differentials for different qualities.
    European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a
compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can
represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures
market's existing differentials for different qualities.
    Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto
the London market.
    Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50
stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.
    Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would
operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the
highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.
    The January talks were slowed by a split inside the
European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France
siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session
in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground
and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions
among the 12 nations.
    The source said the EC will be looking for signs of
flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and
will be able to respond if they are there.
    One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split
said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and
backs the concept of the pact which is ""meant to support the
market where trade buying is not.""
    In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their
cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.
    Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include
whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced
""posted price"" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is
buying then accepting offers.
    In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that
producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of
cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a
way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.

    Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has
the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its
national interests are threatened.
    The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would
search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast
following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill
east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led
oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean.
    Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement
under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the
Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled.
Athens says it considers the accord inactive.
    The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had
received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out
oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined
comment on the statement.
    Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the
long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International
Court of Justice at The Hague.
    Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said
he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General
Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row.

20389,COPA URGES TAX ON VEGETABLE PROTEINS,"The European Community's farmers'
pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax
on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax
which has already been proposed by the EC Commission.
    Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on
Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism
for cereal substitutes.
    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the
Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair
meetings of their EC colleagues.
    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help
the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability
for producers.
    This would in turn help the market position for certain
crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas
and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe
output restrictions.
    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax
on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats
succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC
price fixing.
    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its
proposals for a tax.
    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue
international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of
bridging the gap between EC and world prices.

6351,CHINA TO CUT EXCESSIVE CAPITAL INVESTMENT FURTHER,"China said it will continue its efforts
to cut excessive capital investment, and noted policies to cool
the economy have so far failed.
    Fixed asset investment grew 16.7 pct to 296.7 billion yuan
in 1986, outstripping energy and raw materials growth, the
China Daily quoted Zhou Daojiong, president of the People's
Construction Bank of China, as saying.
    Over 160,000 projects costing 895 billion yuan are now
under construction, and will absorb 60 pct of the funds
earmarked for investment under China's current five-year
economic plan (1986-1990), he said.
    The state-run construction bank will review all investment
projects now under way or scheduled, and immediately halt those
deemed unnecessary or with a poor economic return, Zhou said.
    Over 20 billion yuan of unauthorised spending by local
governments or enterprises were partly responsible for the
overheated rate of investment, he said.
    Another two or three years of measures to curb excessive
investment were needed to bring it under control, Zhou said.

20259,LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS,"U.S. And West German reaffirmation of
support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental
problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.
    ""There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
dollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said Richard Jeffrey of
Hoare Govett. ""If not, there is going to be continued fear that
when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.""
    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
    ""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" said
Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
other London and Tokyo analysts.
    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
    ""It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
interest rates,"" he added.
    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
system.
    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
mind.
    ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel's
Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
danger.
    ""The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
disappearing from the equity markets,"" Dennis noted.
    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
is still on.
    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
stability.

15289,PERU DECREES FIRMS SHOULD BUY TREASURY BONDS,"the Peruvian government decreed that a wide
range of firms would have to earmark between 20 and 30 pct of
their 1986 net profits to buy treasury bonds this year.
    A presidential decree said that banking, financial and
insurance firms as well as bottling and tobacco industries with
1986 sales of more than 1.6 mln intis would have to earmark 30
pct of their net profits from last year to buy the bonds.
    The bonds would be redeemed over the next two years and
their interest rate would be set by the central bank. Textile,
commercial and fishing canneries with sales over 1.24 mln intis
would have to buy bonds equal to 20 pct of profits.
    The firms would have to buy the bonds between April and
December 1987.
   The decree said the government adopted the move to obtain
financing for high-priority investment projects, which it did
not specify.
    The economy ministry says it aims to keep the public
sector's budget deficit to between five and six pct of the
gross domestic product (gdp).
    Last year, the deficit was six pct of gdp, according to the

17934,"CHINA DELAYS REFORM BECAUSE OF POLITICS, ECONOMICS","China had postponed wide-ranging plans to
reform its economy because of financial difficulties and
pressure from powerful conservatives within the ruling
Communist Party, western diplomats said.
    But they said that although the conservatives were critical
of aspects of the current open-door policy they had no
alternative economic program. That meant that the strategy
begun by top leader Deng Xiaoping in 1978 was likely to go on,
but at a slower pace, they said.
    Deng has led China's overhaul of the Stalinist economy
built during the rule of Chairman Mao. Since Mao died in 1976
living standards have risen sharply and China has become a net
exporter of grain for the first time.
    A western diplomat said China's leaders had been
sufficiently encouraged by their success last year to order the
drawing up of plans for more reforms for 1987. These included
changes to the country's price system.
    But he said the biggest reforms had been shelved since
economic problems appeared in late 1986 and the resignation of
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang in January.
    The diplomat said the most ambitious reforms would not be
on the agenda for a major party meeting later this year.
    The main economic reform proceeding in 1987 is a system
under which factories sign contracts with the government. They
can keep any profit over and above the contract amount.
    ""This is a modest reform, a repeat of what China did in the
early 1980s,"" the diplomat said.
    ""It is regarded as second best by the reformers who drew up
the more ambitious plans. But these are impractical in the
current political and economic climate,"" he said.
    A Chinese source said that a month ago Premier Zhao Ziyang
decided the media was giving too much coverage to the drive
against bourgeois liberalism and not enough to explaining the
proposed reforms. Some of these reforms, like price increases,
were very unpopular.
    Zhao ordered the media to give more coverage to the reforms
and why they were necessary, the source said.
    One of China's top economists wrote in the People's Daily
last week, ""Failure to answer people's questions about the new
prices has caused great anxiety.""
    In March, China announced budget deficits for 1986 and
1987. It has had two years of trade deficits, and capital
spending and wages are rising fast.
    On the political front, the conservatives in the Party have
been on the offensive since January when Hu resigned. He
allegedly failed to fight the growth of western democratic
ideas, which the Party has called bourgeois liberalism.
    A nationwide drive against bourgeois liberalism has been
under way since January in the Party and the media. The latter
has given wide coverage to those in the leadership who have
warned against the errors of all-out westernisation.
    The economist said, ""Although reform in any country
inevitably causes anxiety and is often risky, it has been
proved that, where reform is more daring, commodities are more
abundant and people's living standards higher.""
    ""But in the countries that are more rigid, the market is
stagnant, goods are in short supply and rationing is common,"" he
said.
    The diplomat said the reformers wanted to complete their
unfinished overhaul of China's pricing system.
    The diplomat said the reformers wanted to make factories
independent of the government which would use taxes, credit
supply and other indirect means to regulate them instead of
administrative diktat as in the past.
    ""But to enact such far-reaching measures they need a stable
economy, contented workers and surpluses, to give them
manoeuvring room. These conditions do not exist now,"" he said.
    Another diplomat said that conservatives within the
leadership, though critical of some results of the reforms, had
no alternative economic strategy.
    ""The last eight years of opening to the outside world has
shown everyone how poor China is and how it has fallen behind
other countries,"" the diplomat said.
    ""Everyone is agreed on the objective that China become a
major world power by the early 21st century,"" he said.
    ""For this, it needs a strong and modernised economy. Where
there is disagreement is over the pace of the reforms and the
details of some of them.""
    The Chinese source said the debate over the pace and extent
of reforms was still going on.

3542,BRAZIL'S GROS TO MEET BANKS ON TRADE LINE ISSUE,"Brazil's central bank governor
Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today
in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's
unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs
of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.
    Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of
Brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.
    High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil's
accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade
and interbank lines, the bankers said.
    Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed
last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as
part of a 31 billion dlr financing package.
    Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled
with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal
questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.
    They said they face problems because of the freeze
requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank
under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the
central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch
their credit lines from one borrower to another.
    The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also
meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower
interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather
accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the
central bank.
    ""It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community,""
one banker said.
    Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of
a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister
Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for

7405,MEXICO TO SIGN LOAN AMID CALLS FOR CHANGE,"Mexico's 7.7 billion dlr loan package
will be signed in New York tomorrow amid increasing calls from
both creditors and debtors for a streamlining of the tortuous
process of raising such jumbo loans, bankers said.
    Pressure for change has mounted because the Mexican deal
has been even more difficult to syndicate than bankers feared.
    Several tentative signing dates had to be scrapped and even
now, five months after the loan was agreed with a 13-bank
advisory committee on October 16, dozens of Mexico's some 400
creditor banks worldwide are still refusing to participate.
    The resistance to the deal must be seen alongside the fact
that it is the largest loan for a Latin American debtor since
the region's debt crisis flared up in 1983. Mexico will also
sign agreements to reschedule 52.3 billion dlrs of debt.
    Moreover, as the first major package built on U.S. Treasury
Secretary James Baker's strategy of offering loans to countries
willing to implement market-oriented, pro-growth policies,
intense market scrutiny was only to be expected.
    Still, the split within the banks' ranks came as a shock.
""This is not an unsuccessful operation, but we've had more
bickering than ever,"" one senior banker commented.
    Officers at small banks that have sold, swapped or or
written down their Mexican loans say they see no reason why
they should throw good money after bad.
    Major lenders counter that small banks must share the
responsibility of making new loans and cannot expect to keep
receiving interest on old debt unless they join in new ones.
    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford said
recently the reluctance of small banks at one point endangered
the entire Mexican package. Things have improved, but money
center bankers are determined to keep hounding recalcitrant
banks even once the 7.7 billion dlr target has been reached.
    The loan presently is about 98.5 pct committed. ""People who
are outside shouldn't think they've been saved once we get over
7.7 (billion dlrs),"" one warned.
    But rounding up ""free-rider"" banks entails such a huge
drain on management resources that more and more bankers are
acknowledging that the syndicates may have to shrink.
    One idea is to levy new loan contributions on the basis of
current exposure instead of outstandings at an earlier ""base""
date - August 1982 in the case of Mexico. Another streamlining
idea is to allow small banks to escape by swapping their loans
for ""exit bonds"" that a debtor would issue at a discount.
    Argentina has pressed for this solution, so far to no
avail, arguing that the smallest 120 of its 360 bank creditors
account for just one pct of its foreign bank debt and that the
next 120 banks account only for a further six pct.
    Central bank president Jose Luis Machinea said Argentina
may not receive the 2.15 billion dlrs in bank loans it is
seeking until September, which would be a year after
negotiations began with the International Monetary Fund.
    The protracted negotiations have damaged the confidence of
investors in Argentina, forcing up interest rates and spurring
capital flight, he said.
    ""We have to introduce some common sense into the
discussion,"" Machinea said this week in Cambridge, Mass.
    He was echoed by Mexico's deputy planning minister, Pedro
Aspe Armella, who said the delay in signing his country's loan
has made it difficult to map economic policy with any
certainty. ""It's a sad affair,"" he told the Cambridge meeting.
    Bankers said Mexico became so frustrated with the delay in
the loan that it suspended its debt-equity swap program last
month to put pressure on the banks. Other strains have
intensified between U.S. and non-U.S. banks, partly because
U.S. regulations and accounting rules discourage writedowns.
    Critics say this prompts U.S. banks to focus too much on
ensuring steady interest payments from debtors in the short
term, possibly to the detriment of longer-term solutions.
    Because more than half of the banks baulking at the Mexican
deal are American, some foreign bankers think other U.S. banks
should make up the difference.
    This issue of ""national share"" was defused on the Mexican
committee but bankers say it will probably recur in talks with
Argentina and Brazil, whose finance minister Dilson Funaro has
already suggested separate negotiations with regional
committees of creditors.
    Streamlining of the new-money process is running parallel
with efforts to develop a broader ""menu"" of alternatives to new
loans, such as trade credits or debt-equity conversions.
    ""We must face the fact that greater flexibility in devising
new money packages may, in effect, be essential to future bank
syndications,"" Mulford said last week. He told the banks to
stop complaining that there is no leeway in current procedures
and to come up with ideas. Some steps have already been taken -
interest payments for Chile have been stretched out and banks
are debating whether to accept partial interest payments from
the Philippines in paper instead of cash.
    Because the banks want to isolate hard-line Brazil by
clinching a deal with Argentina as soon as practicable, bankers
said the Argentine package is likely to be along the
established lines of the Baker Plan.
    But some bankers are speculating that the Brazilian deal,
when it comes, will be radically different.
    As such, the loan for Mexico could go down in the history
books as the biggest but also the last jumbo. ""I'm convinced
it'll be the last one in this form,"" one banker said.

Reagan Administration officials said.
    The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait

13958,ITALY SAYS G-7 GIVES CHANCE TO VERIFY TOKYO ACCORD,"This week's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in
Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached
at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in
Group of Five (G-5) talks on management of the international
monetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said.
    It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plans
to attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo
accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year.
    On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its
G-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier
session of talks involving G-5 members.
    Today's statement from the Italian Treasury said-
    ""Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it to
be remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for the
enlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever ""the
management or the improvement of the international monetary
economic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.'""
    Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on the
grounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France and Britain, had reduced Italy's role to rubber
stamping agreements already taken.
    The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was ""certain that
this time incidents would not occur.""

19543,HIGHER REVENUES DEAL BLOW TO JAPAN TAX REFORM PLAN,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
diminishing hopes of overhauling the tax system have been dealt
a serious blow by reports of sharply higher than expected tax
revenues in 1986/87, government officials said.
    Nakasone has argued that the tax system must be reformed to
provide the revenue for more than 1,000 billion yen of tax cuts
promised in the government's emergency economic package last
month. But his argument has been undercut by reports that the
1986/87 tax take was as much as 2,500 billion yen more than
expected.
    That means the government should have more than enough
money in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for the
planned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular tax
measures proposed by Nakasone, one official said.
    The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and the
abolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raising
revenue to offset the tax cuts.
    But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea of
an indirect tax, at least for the time being. He still hopes to
gain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks on
small savings.
    The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmed
from increased receipts from land and securities taxes, as
prices of both shares and land soared, one official said.
    But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant than
expected, perhaps indicating the recession of the last year
induced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought, he said.
    The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to be
released by the Finance Ministry on July 1.
    The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercut
attempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduce
investment spending by government departments in the 1988/89
budget, several officials said.
    A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted to
stick with its so-called ""minus-ceiling"" policy, which calls for
government departments to reduce investment spending by five
pct a year.
    But he acknowledged this would be difficult, given the
sharp increase in revenues last fiscal year and heavy domestic
and U.S. Pressure on the ministry to stimulate the economy.

&lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
spokesman said.
    The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
1986 business, despite the provision.
    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit.""
    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
company.
    VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
currency losses were not completed.
    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
evaded justice.
    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
since the new capital was in preference shares.
    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
less than three billion marks.

    The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the

    Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is
only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year
has underpinned new crop corn futures all week.
    However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may
end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade
talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted

program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total

Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said.
    No further details on the loan were immediately available.
    Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion
in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in
the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast.
    The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on
the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and
construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.
    The project also includes construction of liquified
petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional
crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia
complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion
of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.
    Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and

enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz

13496,GERMAN CALL MONEY FIRMS ON TENDER,"Call money firmed to about 3.65 pct,
back to yesterday's 3.60/70 pct, from around 3.55 pct earlier
today after the Bundesbank announced a tender for a new
securities repurchase pact, dealers said.
    The Bundesbank offered funds over 28 days at 3.80 pct,
unchanged from the rate on recent facilities.
    Many traders had expected the tender rate to come down in
line with market rates for call money.
    When this did not happen, because of more than adequate
liquidity, many participants decided to withdraw funds from the
market and use them to build up minimum reserves further.
    This resulted in the slight rise in call money.
    Banks held 58.9 billion marks at the Bundesbank on April 5,
averaging 59.3 billion over the first five days of the month,
well clear of the likely 51 billion mark minimum reserve
requirement, dealers said.
    There was therefore some surprise that the Bundesbank was
offering more funds above the call money rate.
    But some dealers noted that the rate on the 28 day facility
was in line with one month money, which traded at 3.80/85 today
after 3.80/90 yesterday and 3.90/4.00 on April 1.
    Given market liquidity dealers said banks were likely to
bid, and the Bundesbank allocate, less than the 14.9 billion
marks draining from the market tomorrow when an earlier pact
expires.
    One dealer expected some 10 billion marks to be allocated.
    Some dealers said the Bundesbank would have been unwilling
to cut rates on this pact, as it is the first under its faster
and more flexible tender process and because a lower rate might
have been associated with the new system.
    Dealers said they still thought the Bundesbank would over
the next month lower the call money range from the narrow
3.6-3.8 and broad 3.5-4.0 pct it has held recently.

7547,VOLCKER SAYS BRAZIL DEBT MOVE WILL NOT HURT BANKS,"Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Paul Volcker said the suspension by Brazil of its
foreign debt payments would not undermine U.S. Banks.
    But he told Reuters after a speech to educators that it was
in the interest of U.S. Banks to complete debt financing plans
soon with Brazil and other debtor nations.
    ""I don't think it's going to undermine public confidence in
the banking system from Brazil alone,"" he said. ""But I would like
to see further progress made on this whole situation.""
    Brazil announced last month it was temporarily suspending
interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt owed to private
banks, opening a new round in the five-year-old debt crisis.
    Last week, Ecuador suspended interest payments to private
foreign banks, which hold about two-thirds of its total 8.3
billion dlr foreign debt, citing severe damage to its oil
industry caused by an earthquake.
    Citicorp &lt;CCI> the largest U.S. Bank, said last week that
it might have to reclassify most of its 4.6 billion dlrs in
Brazilian loans as non-performing, thus removing them as part
of the bank's expected income-producing assets.
    Analysts said such a move would sharply reduce Citicorp's
profits and might result in similar measures by Brazil's other
bank creditors.
    Volcker said he believed Brazil and Ecuador want to
maintain continuity in their debt service.
    ""It's fundamentally in their best interest. If they can get
the financing and refinancing that's necessary, they may be
able to make their economies grow again.""
    Asked whether he expected other nations to follow the path
taken by Brazil and Ecuador, he said the two countries were

17234,INDIAN BORROWING FROM ADB SEEN RISING,"India, which received its first
loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1986, expects to
increase borrowing this year, an Indian official said.
    The official, a member of the Indian delegation at the
ADB's annual meeting here, told Reuters the bank is likely to
approve three loans totalling between 350 and 400 mln dlrs in
1987, up from the 250 mln in two loans in 1986.
    The official said negotiations on a 100 mln dlr loan for
the modernisation of the Haldia and Madras ports had been
completed and only need approval by the bank's board.
    The official said an ADB team is now in India for a survey
of the second project involving imports of railway locomotives.
He said the bank was also likely to extend a credit line to the
Industrial Development Bank of India.
    The ADB in 1986 extended a 100 mln dlr line of credit to
state-owned Industrial Finance Corp of India.
    The official said the ADB wants to gradually expand lending
to India. ""They (the bank) do not want their traditional
borrowers from smaller countries in the region to get
overwhelmed by (India and China),"" he said. China is expected to
receive its first ADB loan this year.
    ""We are quite satisfied at having opened this new window in
borrowing,"" the official said. ""Our projects are being vetted
quickly. We have no complaints.""
    He said the ADB in any case would not be able to match
Indian borrowing needs.
    ""In fiscal 1986/87 ending June India will borrow two billion
dlrs from the World Bank alone,"" he said.
    ""That represents the total ADB lending to all its borrowers
in 1986.""
    The official said total Indian development assistance from
multilateral and bilateral creditors is likely to total four
billion dlrs in 1986/87.
    Asked to comment on U.S. Criticism of the quality of ADB
lending, the official said: ""The ADB is a regional bank and
ought to have a better understanding of realities in Asia.""
    ""You cannot apply World Bank conditionalities everywhere,"" he

    Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the
enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or ""poison
pill."" Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of
securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover
bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more

    USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the
matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no

    USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the
Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct

deposits in the following ranges: copper, 3.7 pct to 5.08 pct,
lead .99 pct to 1.5 pct, zinc six pct to 9.6 pct, silver 15.63
pct to 79.92 oz per ton, gold .062 to .19 oz per ton, germanium

    In addition, Houston Metals said the weighted average of 25
diamond-drilled holes 375 ft below the 2,600 foot level and 800
ft along the strike assayed gold at .237 oz per ton, silver at
10.91 oz per ton and zinc at 8.99 pct.
    An apparent parallel vein structure at the 2,600 ft level
returned similar values, the company said.
    It added that preliminary metallurgical tests from
representative bulk ore samples indicate the commercial
feasability of producing a zinc and a copper-lead concentrate.

13818,"MIDWEST CASH GRAIN - MODEST MOVEMENT, BIDS FIRM","Country movement of corn and soybeans
increased modestly this morning, and basis bids were steady to
higher, cash grain dealers said.
    Basis bids firmed in response to lower rates for barge
freight, traders said, noting that the Ohio River is swelling
with snow runoff, discouraging barge loadings because of the
high water levels.
    Moderate bookings continued in new crop soybeans, mostly
for January 1988 delivery, with farmers pricing at least a
portion of their crop at five dlrs a bushel or better when bids
emerge at that level, they said.
    Movement in Iowa was expected to slow considerably in the

2878,BRAZIL CRISIS SPURS RETHINK OF DEBT STRATEGY,"Brazil's economic crisis is forcing a
wholesale re-examination of the established strategy for
dealing with developing-country debt, leading bankers say.
    While finance minister Dilson Funaro is unlikely to succeed
in his attempt at seeking an outright political solution to the
debt problem, Brazil's suspension of interest payments on 68
billion dlrs of commercial bank debt has convinced at least
some bankers that new ideas are needed.
    ""The time has come to look at the alternatives,"" one
seasoned debt rescheduler said.
    Even before Brazil's move, the difficulty in syndicating
the 77 billion dlr financing package for Mexico agreed to in
principle last October was prompting top bankers to examine 
the way they are managing the debt crisis.
    Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, too, spoke recently
of ""debt fatigue"" and the need to breathe new life into debt
rescheduling procedures.
    There are already signs of change. Japanese banks are
setting up a jointly owned firm to which they will transfer
some LDC loans in a bid to strengthen their balance sheets,
improve financial management and get tax breaks.    
    But bankers said a move toward a greater governmental role
will be gradual. ""The process is such that you cannot expect
tangible progress in a short period of time,"" one banker said.
    Certainly, Funaro got a frosty reception in Washington and
several European capitals in the past week when he called on
government officials to explain Brazil's crusade for a
political dialogue on debt.
    Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary David Mulford, for
instance, criticized what he called large-scale solutions such
as debt forgiveness or the creation of new multilateral lending
agencies.
    ""While such approaches may have some political appeal, they
are impractical and ultimately counterproductive,"" Mulford told
a House subcommittee this week. He could have added that any
proposal that might be construed as a bail-out of U.S. banks
would be a non-starter in Congress.
    But bankers said the Reagan Administration could promote
accounting and regulatory changes to foster debt-equity swaps
and debt securitization and to enable banks to consider
interest capitalization as an alternative to new loans.
    Experts say the government must also make it easier for
banks gradually to write down their third-world loan books.
    Mulford, in his Congressional testsimony, urged the banks
to explore different options. ""The banks should be encouraged
to look at the so-called menu approach,"" he said.
    Bankers said the aim would be to keep the loan syndicates
intact or, conversely, to allow small banks to write off their
exposure in a way that is not detrimental to major lenders.
    Big banks say it is unfair that small creditors continue to
receive interest on old debt even if they do not contribute to
new loans. In effect, large banks say they are making new loans
that fund the interest payments on the old debt.
    To solve this problem - and to streamline the cumbersome
negotiating process - Argentina has revived the idea of ""exit
bonds"", which would be issued at a discount to small creditors
in exchange for their existing debt, bankers said. The banks
would be rid of the loans but would have to recognize a loss.
    Amid the swirl of new ideas, even the role of the
commercial bank advisory committees has come under scrutiny.
    The principle of consensus on which the panels operate was
challenged recently when Citibank - ironically, the original
architect of the committee system - stubbornly refused for a
time to endorse financing offers to the Philippines and Chile.
    The strains have not gone unnoticed in Washington. ""There
does seem to be a lot of speculation about the frailty of the
bank advisory committees,"" a U.S. official said.
    Brazil's Funaro heavily criticized the panels in London on
Monday, charging that they are unresponsive to new ideas and
that U.S. banks are over-represented on them.
    Hannes Androsch, chairman of Austria's
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, said there was some truth to the
charge. ""Sentiment is growing in Europe that we're no longer
prepared to bail out the U.S. banks,"" he told reporters in New
York this week.
    While U.S. bankers obviously see things differently, some
have started to wonder whether the advisory committee is still
the right tool for the job.
    ""The debt crisis has probably evolved beyond the capacity
of commercial banks alone, at least in some cases,"" one top New
York rescheduler said.
    But, with governments unable or unwilling to play a larger
role, bankers see no alternative to the advisory committee.
    ""It's the worst form of government there is apart from all
the others,"" one banker said, paraphrasing former British prime
minister Winston Churchill's opinion about democracy.

&lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.
    CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer's 99.80 mln issued
shares, it said in a statement.
    The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share
capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closing
market level of 1.85 dlrs a share.
    CSR said it will announce further details of the offer
soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer
Sugar stock.
    It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer
Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's net
earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over
yesterday's market price which CSR said it believed already
contained an element of takeover speculation.
    It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's last
reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said.
    CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings
which will flow from integrated management of CSR's and
Pioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses.
    These economies can only be achieved through CSR control
and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.

13239,PHILIPPINES APPROVES 80 MLN DLR DEBT CONVERSION,"The Central Bank has approved the
conversion of 80.7 mln dlrs worth of Philippine debt into
equity in local projects under a debt-to-equity swap program
started last August, Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin said.
    He told reporters the amount represented 57 transactions
involving diversified investments. He said 90 applications to
convert 316.7 mln dlrs of debt have so far been received by the
Central Bank.
    Ongpin also said the International Finance Corp (IFC), a
World Bank affiliate, would invest up to 12.5 mln dlrs in the
First Philippine Capital Fund.
    The fund, to be launched jointly by New York investment
house Shearson Lehman Brothers and IFC, was proposed by Ongpin
during a trip to the United States in September.
    There was still no word on when the fund, designed to
encourage private sector investment in the Philippines, would
be launched.
    A telex from IFC to Ongpin said the IFC investment will
consist of exchanging up to 12.5 mln dlrs face value of
Philippine debt it holds.
    The capital fund and the Central Bank's debt conversion
plan are both aimed at reducing the country's debt burden by
enabling interested investors to buy government notes at a
discount, repatriate these and convert them at full value in
pesos.
    The proceeds will then be used to investing in local
projects.
    The country's foreign debt now stands at 27.8 billion dlrs.

1933,SPAIN RAISES BANKS' RESERVE REQUIREMENT,"The Bank of Spain said it raised the
reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of
deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened
money supply and inflation targets.
    In a statement issued late last night, the central bank
said the measure would take effect from March 13.
    ""In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the
Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the
monetary and inflation targets set by the government,"" the
statement said.
    Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200
billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve
requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.
    The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the
Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands
at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the
rate unchanged.
    Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based
liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of
8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of
1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.
    Banking sources said that although the January money supply
figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct
in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared
to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.
    Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that
prices were under control.
    Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez
Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for
February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from
six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during
1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

20243,SWISS 1988 BUDGET HAS 1.3 BILLION FRANC SURPLUS,"The Swiss government's proposed 1988 budget
projects a 1.3 billion franc surplus, the Finance Ministry
announced.
    Income is expected to rise 11.6 mln francs to 27.22
billion, while expenditure is seen increasing 7.1 mln to 25.95
billion next year. After internal transfers, net income was
planned to total 637 mln francs.
    The ministry also announced that higher than expected
income during 1987 would likely boost this year's surplus
significantly higher than the 171 mln francs budgeted.
    The ministry said the encouraging development of
Switzerland's finances was due to steady economic growth since
1983 and the government's conservative fiscal policy.
    Although the dollar's weakness is likely to dampen economic
growth slightly in 1988 by depressing exports, domestic
investment and consumer demand were expected to remain strong.
    Real gross national product growth was seen rising two pct,
while annual inflation was also projected to reach two pct.

26,BANKERS REPORT BREAKTHROUGH ON VENEZUELAN DEBT,"Venezuela and its bank advisory
committee have agreed in principle on revisions to the terms of
a 21 billion dlr debt-rescheduling package signed last
February, bankers said.
    They declined to disclose details because two or three
representatives on the panel have still to obtain the approval
of their senior management for the new terms.
    The committee was meeting in New York this afternoon and
could put its final stamp of approval of the deal later today,
the bankers said.
    ""A number of details have still to be finalized, but the
broad details of the new amortization schedules and interest
rates are in place,"" one senior banker said.
    The interest rate on the rescheduling was originally set at
1-1/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, but Venezuela requested easier
terms because of a 40 pct drop in oil income last year.
    It also asked for a reduction in the repayments it was due
to make in 1987, 1988 and 1989 - after an earlier request that
it make no amortizations at all in those years was rebuffed -
and sought a commitment from the banks to finance new
investment in Venezuela.
    The breakthrough in the Venezuelan talks, which have been
going on intermittently for several months, follows the
announcement earlier today of a 10.6 billion dlr debt
rescheduling pact between Chile and its bank advisory panel.
    And last night Citibank said Mexico's financing package,
including a 7.7 billion dlr loan, will be signed on March 20.
    While the sudden progress is to some extent coincidental,
bankers acknowledge a desire to chalk up some quick successes
after the shock of Brazil's unilateral interest suspension last
Friday. By striking swift deals, banks hope to reduce the
incentive for other debtors to emulate Brazil.

suspended several other staff members following the recent
emergence of a possible currency fraud at the company.
    A VW statement said foreign exchange department chief
Burkhard Junger had been dismissed with immediate effect.
    It said it has also suspended Guenther Borchert, head of
the financial transfer department, and Siegfried Mueller, head
of the central cash and currency clearing department. Four
other members of the foreign exchange staff were also
suspended.
    VW said the possibly fraudulent foreign currency
transactions, which could cost the company 480 mln marks, fell
directly within the area of responsibility of Borchert and
Mueller.
    VW said Adalbert Sedlmair, formerly finance director at
VW's former office equipment subsidiary Triumph-Adler AG, would
temporarily take over responsibility of the financial transfer
department during Borchert's suspension from duties.
    Meanwhile, the state prosecutor's office in Brunswick,
which is looking into the currency transactions, said the
Federal Criminal Office in Wiesbaden had also joined the
investigation and would be responsible for measures such as
possible police searches.
    A spokeswoman for the office said prosecutors in Frankfurt

3813,EL PASO ELECTRIC &lt;ELPA> REACHES NEW MEXICO PACT,"El Paso Electric Co said it has
agreed to limit rate increases in its New Mexico service
territory to a maximum of nine pct over the next three years.
    Last year, about 18 pct of the utility's revenues came from
New Mexico, 70 pct from retail electricity sales in Texas and
12 pct from wholesale sales under federal regulation.
    In January the company filed a formal rate case with New
Mexico regulators seeking a 21.66 pct increase in its annual
rates there which would have been equal to about 13.9 mln dlrs
net of fuel savings.
    El Paso Electric said it reached a stipulated settlement on
its New Mexico rates with several parties, including the state
of the New Mexico Public Service Commission, which provides for
rate treatment of the utility's investment in the Palo Verde
Nuclear Generating Station located near Phoenix, Ariz.
    The company said commission hearings on the stipulated
settlement are expected to start next month. If it is approved,
the new rates could go into effect as early as this summer. El
Paso Electric's January rate case will remain before the
commission pending approval of the settlement.
    El Paso Electric said the agreement provides got continued
full inclusion in its rate base of the costs of Palo Verda Unit
one, maximum rate increases of three pct on a cents per
kilowatt hour basis in 1987, 1988 and 1989, and no further rate
increases until 1994.
    Once the agreement is approved, the utility would still
have to prove cost of service increases to support at least the
maximum increase each year, a spokesman explained.
    The company said it will attempt to settle the cost of
service issues in timed to allow the new rates to go into
effect this summer.
    El Paso Electric said the agreement allows recovery in its
New Mexico rates of lease payments in connection with the
utility's 1986 sale and leaseback of its investment in Palo
Verde Unit Two to the extent of the book value sold.
    The company said it agreed that none of its costs for Palo
Verde Unit Three will be included in its New Mexico rates.
    The utility said the agreement also resolves any issue
relating to the prudence of the planning, management and
construction of Palo Verde and settles any possible issue of
excess generating capacity through 1993.
    El Paso Electric said it does not expect to have excess
generating capacity.
    The agreement also provides that any portion of the cost of
service deferrals not recouped prior to December 31, 1994 will
not be recovered through New Mexico rates, the company said,
adding it expects to recoup all deferrals in full by that date.

17778,ALLEGIS &lt;AEG> FILING MAY BE LATER THIS WEEK,"Allegis Corp may file its plan of
recapitalization with the Securities and Exchange Commission
later this week, a company spokesman said.
    The spokesman also said the company has no comment on
Coniston Partners plan to carry out its solicitation of
consents from shareholders to remove Allegis directors.
    Coniston proposes replacing the board of directors with its
own candidates and then selling off one or more units of
Allegis. Allegis, apparently in response to takeover activity,
announced a sweeping recapitalization plan, which will give
shareholders 60 dlrs per share.
    Allegis shares came under pressure from institutional
selling today. The stock slipped 1-3/8 to 85-1/8 on volume of
more than 1.6 mln shares. Traders said there was also
arbitrage-related buying.
    PaineWebber Group analyst Edward Starkman said institutions
and other long-term holders may want to cash in their gains
instead of waiting for the company's special dividend, which
would be taxed at a higher rate. The recapitalization is
subject to shareholder and other approvals.
    Starkman said he believes Coniston may still have a chance
to win the battle for control of Allegis' board room, despite
the recapitalization plan.
    Coniston Partners would not comment on the recapitalization
plan.
    ""We said a week ago, and we say it again today that the way
to maximize value for shareholders is to see these companies
traded as independent companies,"" said Keith Gollust, one of
the partners.
    Allegis owns United Air Lines, Hertz rental cars, and
Westin and Hilton International hotels.
    Allegis' recapitalization plan does not entail the sale of
any of those businesses, which its management claims are
necessary to its travel services strategy. The recapitalization
plan would add three billion dlrs in debt to its balance sheet.
    Some Wall Street analysts believe such a move could be
risky since the airline, as well as other travel businesses,
are dependant on the strength of the economy.
    ""They've become sort of a super cyclical company,"" Starkman
said. The hotels and car rental business represents ""no
diversification. It just makes it worse.""
    Traders and analysts who believe Coniston's effort may have
a chance believe that Allegis management is not giving
shareholders full value. After receiving the dividend,
shareholders will still hold their stock. Arbitragers and
analysts valued the recapitalization in the upper 80s to 100
dlrs per share.
    Breakup values for the company estimated on Wall Street
exceed 110 dlrs per share.

8070,GERMAN ECONOMY SEEN GROWING TWO PCT IN 1987,"Bundesbank vice-president Helmut
Schlesinger said that although West German economic growth was
not expected to be satisfactory in the first 1987 quarter, two
pct growth was still attainable for the whole of the year.
    A further rise in the value of the mark would worsen export
prospects and have a negative effect on investments, he told
the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in an interview. But if such
an appreciation did not materialize, the economy would expand.
    The federal government has predicted a growth rate of 2-1/2
pct or more in its annual economic report published in January,
but some economists have said the forecast was too optimistic.
    Schlesinger said private consumption was likely to rise
strongly. Government expenditure and construction were also
expected to increase. But there was uncertainty about the
prospects for exports and investment.
    The Bundesbank had viewed with concern the money supply
overshoot in 1986, but the sharp rise was unlikely to have an
effect on inflation in the forseeable future. However, there
were potential dangers in the long run.
    Schlesinger said there was hope that in 1987 the West
German money supply would grow within the three to six pct
target zone set in December.
    Schlesinger said the dampening effect on inflation of the
drop in import prices could continue to a lesser degree for
some time. Prices in West Germany were likely to rise between
one and two pct this year.
    He said 1987 would be the fifth successive growth year for
the West German economy. Although there was a possibility of a
downturn at some stage in the future, there were no signs this
would happen in 1988.
    The main risks for the West German economy stemmed from its
close ties with the rest of the world, Schlesinger added.

5186,PHILIPPINES' ONGPIN OPTIMISTIC ON DEBT TALKS,"Philippines finance minister Jaime
Ongpin said he was cautiously optimistic an accord on debt
rescheduling would be reached with commercial bank creditors,
as he prepared for the third week of talks starting Monday.
    ""One can never be too optimistic, but I'm cautiously
optimistic that we can get an agreement....We think we're close
to a deal,"" Ongpin told Reuters by telephone.
    He said he had received a new proposal from the banks late
Friday and had spent the weekend evaluating it with other
members of the Philippine delegation.
    Ongpin declined to disclose details of the banks' new offer
and bankers also declined to be specific ahead of their next
meeting with Ongpin on Monday. But one senior banker said he
too was guardedly optimistic a deal could be struck, possibly
by the end of the week.
    Still at the heart of the talks is Ongpin's offer to pay
part of the country's interest bill in Philippine Investment
Notes, PINs, instead of cash. The bank creditors' advisory
committee led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co rejected the
concept as it was originally drafted, but the counter-proposal
made on Friday contains a revised version, bankers said.
    Manila, seeking to reschedule 9.4 billion dlrs of its total
debt of 27.2 billion, wants to pay the London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR) in cash and a margin above LIBOR in PINs.
    These dollar-denominated notes would be sold by banks at a
discount to multi-national firms which would then convert them
at face value with the central bank, thus receiving subsidized
pesos for use in funding government-approved investments.
    Effectively foreign companies would be paying the interest
margin above LIBOR. The Philippines would conserve foreign
exchange and enjoy investment inflows, reducing marginally the
need to seek new bank loans.
    But the banks rejected the PINs proposal in its original
form, fearing regulatory and accounting problems.
    They were also reluctant to veer from the principle that
interest should be paid in cash not paper, fearing that other
debtor nations would emulate the idea, bankers said.
    Ongpin sweetened his original offer by guaranteeing that
his government would redeem the notes at 7/8 pct over LIBOR if
there was no buyer in the secondary market.
    Last week the banks came under pressure to accept this,
when senior U.S. Officials endorsed it as fully consistent with
Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt strategy.
    But banking sources said that the margin over LIBOR was
still a sticking point.
    After Venezuela clinched a revised rescheduling agreement
last month at 7/8 pct over LIBOR, some New York bankers
imediately claimed that 7/8 pct should be seen as a new
benchmark for a debtor that needs no new loans, is current on
interest and is repaying some principal.
    The Philippines meets the first two criteria but not the
third.

17780,CONGRESSMAN SAYS U.S. UNPREPARED FOR OIL CUTOFF,"Rep. Mike Synar said today that while
President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect
Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared
at home to deal with a new energy crisis.
    Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments
on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.
participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing
program of the International Energy Agency.
    The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was
formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal
with any future oil cutoff.
    Synar said, ""the president is prepared to take military
action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to
take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our
nation for the next energy crisis.""
    Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers
to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,
increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar,
who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in
a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully
advocated a test limited to training participants in oil
sharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.

7925,AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> AND UNIT GET SUBPOENAS,"American Express Co said it was
subpoenaed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
connection with documents on transactions in securities of
American Express and its former unit, Fireman's Fund.
    American Express said its brokerage unit, Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc was also served with a subpoena. Shearson acted as
co-manager in the underwriting of units of Fireman's common
stock and warrants last May, was also served with a subpoena,
it said.
    American Express said the subpoena to Shearson relates to
transactions with Jefferies and Co and others.
    American Express said it and Shearson intend to comply with
all requests from the SEC and to cooperate fully. American
Express said neither company is aware of any unlawful conduct
with respect to the matters and a thorough investigation is
continuing.
    American Express said the subpoenas were received
yesterday, and that it and Shearson were unaware of any inquiry
prior to receiving the subpoenas.
    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, founder of Jefferies Group, said
he agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of securities
violations.
    Jefferies also settled charges with the Securities and
Exchange Commission of market manipulation and another scheme
with Ivan Boesky, who has settled SEC charges of insider
trading.
    Jefferies' firm was censured by the SEC and ordered to
retain an outside consultant to review its procedures.
    In documents filed on Jefferies yesterday, the SEC did not
identify who was involved in the market manipulation scheme
aside from Jefferies. It said ""a certain issuer,"" which held
controlling interest in a second public company, offered
several mln shares of the company's common stock to the public
in a secondary offering during 1986.
    The SEC alleged that Boyd Jefferies carried out a scheme
with an unidentified person to drive up the price of the second
company's stock prior to the offering by having the Jefferies
firm trade in the stock.
    Jefferies and co was allegedly compensated for the loss
from those trading activities after sending a fake invoice to
another unnamed person, the government charged.
    American Express first offered Fireman's Fund Corp's stock
to the public in 1985. It lowered its holding from 100 pct to
41 pct. In May, 1986, it reduced its ownership interest to 27
pct by completing a public offering of nine mln units.
    Each unit consisted of one share of common and one warrant
to buy Fireman's fund. The warrants are exercisable from the
issue date through March, 1989.
    At the same time, American Express sold warrants directly
to Fireman's Fund to purchase five mln shares. Those warrants
are exercisable between November, 1988 and March 1991.
    American Express said if all warrants were exercised it
would own about 13 pct of Fireman's fund.
    American Express stock fell 1-1/2, to 77-1/4 on volume of
1.9 mln shares. The stock had been strong in the last two days,
first on rumors, then an announcement of an understanding
American Express reached to sell Nippon Life Insurance Co 13
pct of Shearson.
    Wall Street has also been anticipating American Express
will sell a stake in the brokerage unit to the public as well.
    E.F. Hutton analyst Michael Lewis said he does not believe
the subpoenas will affect Nippon's deal with American Express,
but it could result in a delay of the public offering
anticipated for Shearson.

    ""If they're forced to keep a bigger percentage of Shearson
a little longer...big deal. They're certainly not going to
throw Shearson away. Shearson is still an attractive asset,"" he
said.
    American Express has not commented on speculation it would
offer part of Shearson to the public, but it has said it was
continuing to review options for the brokerage.
    Analysts had speculated an offering of a part of Shearson
would be forthcoming shortly.
    ""It puts a cloud over it for a while...The market is
anxious to see them consumate whatever they were going to
consumate,"" Lewis said.

19432,NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA,"President Reagan's nominee as top
policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an
agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock
price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the
globalization of financial markets.
    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday
to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed
John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record
six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.
    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its
investigators have probed into the most colossal insider
trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.
    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in
recent months as a growing number of well known traders and
prominent investment banking firms have been charged with
wrongdoing.
    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after
Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock
speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators
and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal
profits after being charged with insider trading.
    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new
phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by
computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in 
securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have
combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented
volatility to some U.S. securities markets.
    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some
lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate
takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers
steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.
    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign
exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork
for an international securities marketplace in which trading
occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.
    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment
opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce
U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.
    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial
disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,
eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to
spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's
review of hostile corporate takeovers.
    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton
investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to
the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.
    In line with the views of other top administration
officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover
battles over new federal regulations.
    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider
trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that
topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the
administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.
    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with
Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to
significantly alter the commission's current priorities.
    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them
lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that
figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the
agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.
    The agency is one of the few in the government that
actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past
few years because of fees it charges public companies,
investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.
    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,
meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the
president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing
for policy differences alone.
    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same
political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request
each year instead of leaving this to the White House.
    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins
to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed
in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted
market manipulations by large investment firms.
    The agency requires public companies and investment
vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on
their financial condition and to disclose changes in their
condition any time they issue new securities.
    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to
register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and
it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.
    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial
magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to
become the nation's 35th president.
    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served
from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in
1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's
first term and was Reagan's director of the Central
Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

8596,(CORRECTED) - PHILIPPINES CRITICISES EC FOR OIL LEVY,"Philippines Trade and
Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers
he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the

    Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC
Council of Ministers, he noted that ""I cannot help but wonder
whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of

5394,ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY,"The European Monetary System marks its
eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money
markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability
in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,
which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow
fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.
    Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has
been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike
seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.
    And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as
Europe's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality
when Belgium minted the world's first Ecu coin.
    But economists say members such as West Germany have so far
blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system's
founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and
former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
    Under this phase, originally due to have started two years
after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been
transferred from national governments and central banks to an
autonomous European Monetary Fund.
    But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in
economic and monetary matters. ""The basic problem of the EMS is
that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a
situation where certain decisions are taken in common,"" said one
economist who has closely watched the system's development.
    The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on
third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the
system's greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.
    Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and
investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp
rise of the West German mark severely strained the system.
    Another frustration has been Britain's failure to lend the
EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world
currency, outside the system.
    No change in the British government's attitude is expected
before the country's next general elections, due by mid-1988.
    Meanwhile, the system's last realignment, the 11th since it
was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC's
highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central
Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.
    Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers
hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.
    But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve
more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical
about the chances for any fundamental change.
    ""Technical measures won't be enough to protect the EMS
against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we
must take the step forward to the institutional level,"" said Leo
de Corel of Kredietbank's economic research department.
    Economists say the system's fortunes now will depend
largely on the success of an agreement last month among major
industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates. If the dollar
resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence, they
predict.

    Asked if Hong Kong Land had any plans for investment
overseas a spokesman said ""Not at the moment. It's a long-term

    The London newspaper Daily Telegraph yesterday quoted Simon
Keswick, chairman of Hong Kong Land's parent company, Jardine

crossroads because the last of its non-property assets will
soon be spun off.
    Hongkong Land's residential properties have also been sold,

    ""If we can't find any opportunities we might have to look

6209,U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM,"The House of Representatives
approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains
farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at
least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if
they did not plant.
    The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers
in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed
by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.
    Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92
provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S.
Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.
    USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying
crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed
broad-scale revision of farm programs.
    The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from
planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the
deficiency payments they would have received.
    To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a
different crop on that land this spring, although they could
use the land for grazing or to plant hay.
    USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs,
largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.
    The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers
along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented
from planting crops this year because of residual damage from
last fall's flooding.
    In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full
payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved
by Congress last fall.
    Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs
in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the
region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.
    The administration said it opposed the bill because, by
expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart
efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an
alternative to federal disaster assistance.
    USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were
narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option
to all major commodities and would produce insignificant
savings.
    USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers
would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the
requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would
cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by
Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln
dlrs.
    USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln
dlrs.
    In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987
winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.
    But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to
wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling
on the disaster assistance program.

14862,SOUTH KOREA MOVES TO SLOW GROWTH OF TRADE SURPLUS,"South Korea's trade surplus is growing too
fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it
down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
    He told a press conference the government planned to
increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market
to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold
the surplus ""at a proper level.""
    But he said the government would not allow the won to
appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has
been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.
    The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with
the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3
billion dlrs in 1985.
    Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects
were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government
would try to hold the current account surplus to around five
billion dlrs a year for the next five years.
    ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five
billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in
exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now
the surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said.
    Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35
pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this
year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.
    Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a
surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr
deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the
country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first
time.
    South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs
in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest
in Asia.
    ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the
major constraints on our development... Last year was a major
turning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said.
    Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of
foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from
about 50 pct in 1986.
    ""The government, however, does not want to accelerate
reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" he
said.
    Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation
and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,
particularly the United States.
    ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but
we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a
proper level,"" Kim said.

5290,LEADING INDUSTRIAL NATIONS TO MEET IN APRIL,"Leading industrial nations will meet
again next month to review their accord on currency stability,
but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now
the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic
growth.
    The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly
suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the
normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem
likely to build on that stability.
    A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement
last month was the main reason markets were calm.
    But he said in an interview that financial markets also
understood, ""That all six countries concluded that the measures
to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster
stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in
fact what has happened since Paris.""
    Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by
the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and
cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives.
    Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but
left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings.
    The official refused to comment, however, on whether the
agreement included a secret pact to consider further
coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations
have taken jointly several times in the past year.
    On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were
within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic
conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget
deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth.
    The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future
international talks.
    ""I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand
politically and the stronger he is politically the better off
we are with the Congress and the better off we are in
international fora,"" said the official, an Administration
economic policymaker. ""So it would be beneficial to the
continued conduct of our initiatives.""
    But the official also said the Administration would resist
calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target
Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability.
    Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret 
short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific
agreement to defend those bands with intervention.
    According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to
1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar.
    There is no official confirmation that specific bands  were
set, although the agreement used the term ""ranges"", for the first
time in an international economic agreement.
    The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to
foster currency stability around current levels.
    Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to
stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached
1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to
have intervened to curb sterling's strength.
    International monetary sources say finance ministers and
central bankers, who will review market performance and their
own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington
just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the
International Monetary Fund.
    The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris
pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker.
    Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing,
while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to
show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing.
    Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently
when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told
bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if
the Fed was ready to follow suit.
    A Reagan Administration official said this would show there
had been some change in approach on the part of the central
bank in Germany.
    But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by
the Fed and the Bundesbank.
    ""If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked
about it, it would no longer be private,"" said the official, who
asked not to be identified.
    Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank
is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the
major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S.
Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated
action could be on the April agenda.

20029,JAPAN TRIES TO STEM STOCKS DIVE,"Government and monetary authorities today
staged a concerted effort to calm spreading panic on Japanese
stock exchanges but market analysts said there were limits to
their ability to succeed.
    ""The ability of the Big Four (Japanese securities houses)
and the Finance Ministry is limited,"" said Barclays de Zoete
Wedd economist Peter Morgan.
    Finance Ministry officials asked the big four securities
companies this afternoon to help calm panic selling on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, ministry officials said.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News
Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation.
    But he rejected comparisons with the 1929 stock market
collapse and subsequent recession.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock
market should not be gravely affected by downturns in New York
and London because there are clear signs of a Japanese economic
recovery and exchange rate stability.
    Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita also tried to calm
the panic, saying in a statement that world stock markets were
excessively concerned about the economic future.
    Traditionally, the four big houses  -- Nomura Securities Co
Ltd, Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd, Daiwa Securities Co Ltd, and
Nikko Securities Co Ltd -- have influenced the market because
of their sheer size and overwhelming market share.
    This strength has in the past made it possible for the
brokerages to calm down markets under guidance from the Finance
Ministry, analysts said.
    But the analysts questioned whether the brokerages, which
have already suffered heavy losses from falling bond markets
over the past year, would have the strength this time to turn
things around.
    ""The question is, are the Japanese brokerages strong enough
to force investors to buy,"" said Johsen Takahashi, research
director at the Mitsubishi Research Institute.
    ""If we consider that they have suffered serious losses in
the bond markets and in their U.S. Investments, it is debatable
whether they they could support buying,"" he said.
    ""We can support things to some extent, but we can't
completely suppress selling,"" said one Japanese broker.
    Some analysts said the high percentage of shares cross-held
by financial institutions and other corporations could have a
stabilising effect on the market.
    Some 80 pct of shares are held by corporate shareholders,
said Keikichi Honda, general manager of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd's
economic research division. ""This is a tightly woven textile. In
its own way it is stronger than Wall Street.""
    But other analysts expressed doubt about this argument.
    ""If a high percent of shares is cross held, everything
happens at the edges and the relative moves can be larger,"" said
Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson. ""Selling
will drive prices down an enormous distance because of no
liquidity.""
    ""You don't need big volume to get big declines in the market
-- you just need a huge imbalance between sellers and buyers,""
said Barclay's Morgan.
    Shares held by what are termed ""stable shareholders,"" or
banks and other companies with which a firm does business,
might also find their way onto the market if the outlook gets
bad enough, some analsyst said.
    ""Closely held shares could become unclosely held,"" said
Morgan. But he said such a prospect is unlikely right now
because companies, with their improved earnings prospects, do
not need to sell shares for cash flow reasons.

13034,UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION ON TOKYO TRIP,"The U.K. Government hopes for a
breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies
during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister
Michael Howard, political sources said.
    Howard, who leaves for Japan tomorrow, told Reuters he will
try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit.
    Meanwhile, Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in
solving the row over a U.K. Firm's bid to win a significant
role in Japan's telecommunications market, government sources
said.
    Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm
itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be
used against certain Japanese financial institutions.
    Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from
Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, seeing it as a
signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory
outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>,
government officials said.
    But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo
that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than
politeness in the face of British anger, they added.
    Howard said he would use his trip to push for a bigger role
in Japan's telecommunications industry for Cable and Wireless
Plc. The U.K. Government has made the issue a test case for
Japan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outside
competition.
    Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of
attempts by Britain to achieve that, Howard said ""I am not sure
it is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection of
Mrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking a
personal interest in this problem.
    ""I don't understand it to be closed at all.""
    Howard added that during his Tokyo visit he would be
""talking to them about it (the letter), finding out exactly what
they do mean about it, and making it plain that we take a very
serious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not
as free as we allow access to our markets to be.""
    He noted that under the new Financial Services Act, Britain
could revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance
institutions in London if U.K. Firms fail to receive similar
treatment in financial markets in Japan soon.
    ""I hope it won't come to that, and I don't think it will,""
Howard added.
    During the trip Howard will meet officials in the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, the Trade Ministry,
and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shunjiro Karasawa.
    Karasawa is regarded as behind opposition to any
significant role for Cable and Wireless in the Japanese
telecommunications industry.
    Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were undermined
again today by fears of a possible U.K./Japanese trade war.
This was despite denials by Trade and Industry Secretary Paul
Channon that Britain was on the verge of a trade war.
    He told a meeting of insurance brokers today that Britain
believed a ""sensible solution"" could be found which would open
Japanese markets to British goods.
    Government officials were at pains today to deny that
Britain had set a deadline of three weeks for Japan to promise
similar access to its financial markets to U.K.-based financial
firms as that enjoyed in London by equivalent Japanese firms.
    They said that Department of Trade and Industry officials
had said yesterday that the measures against Japanese financial
institutions could be imposed from then but that this did not
necessarily constitute a deadline.
    Experts believe Britain would lose out by acting against
Japanese banks, insurance and investment institutions. But
despite the danger of Japanese firms taking their trade
elsewhere in Europe, Howard said he did not expect the move to
backfire.
    He said in a radio interview today  ""it is true that we
benefit from their presence - but they would not want to lose
those advantages. And I am sure they are making their views
plain to the Japanese government on this matter.""
    Howard, who will also be visiting South Korea before
returning to London on April 11, said his trip to Tokyo was
planned well before the current trade row.
    Howard said his talks with Japanese officials would also
include ways of jointly combating financial fraud in global
markets with Japanese officials. This would be done through a
cooperation between national regulatory bodies.
    He said a memorandum of understanding for exchanging
information to combat financial fraud would be sought with
Japan on terms similar to one signed last autumn between
Britain and the United States.

10829,TECHNOLOGY/IBM'S NEW COMPUTER NERVOUSLY AWAITED,"International Business Machines Corp
&lt;IBM> is widely expected to deeply affect the personal computer
industry this week when it announces a long awaited new
generation of desktop machines.
     The four new computers, expected to be called the Personal
System 2 family, are almost sure to veer away from industrywide
standards for personal computers that were first established by
IBM six years ago.
     The result id the new computers will be harder to copy and
less likely to work with software and attachments designed for
existing standards. Some market researchers are already
predicting slower growth as customers adjust to the change.
    A proprietary IBM pc will cause the pc market's growth to
be flat or even negative in 1988 as vendors and users delay
purchases to gauge the importance of the new machine,'' said
John McCarthy, consultant with Forrester Research Inc.
     IBM is traditionally very close-mouthed about unannounced
products, but so intense is the interest in these machines that
some details have leaked out and consultants, dealers and the
trade press are rife with information, both factual or
supposed.
    The four computers expected to be announced April 2 will
reportedly include one low end, low cost computer, two models
that will resemble IBM's current high-end AT, and, most
importantly, a computer incorporating Intel Corp's &lt;INTC> 80386
microprocessor, the powerhouse chip that is revolutionizing the
personal computer.
    The microprocessor is the brains of a computer and Intel
microprocessors are the ones used in all IBM and IBM-compatible
personal computers, by far the largest segment of the desktop
market.
     The 80386, more commonly called the 386, processes
computer instructions twice as fast as the chips used in
existing IBM computers and 386-based desktop computers are as
powerful as the much larger minicomputers of a few years ago.
     Although IBM will not be the first company to introduce a
386 personal computer - Compaq Corp &lt;CPQ> was - most industry
consultants believe that customers will not rush to embrace the
new generation until they see what the world's largest computer
company is going to do.
    What IBM will apparently do is introduce a computer that
is, at least temporarily, copy-proof. That is a far different
situation than exists with IBM's current family of personal
computers, which are cloned widely.
     With the Personal System, IBM will reportedly build as
many features as possible directly into the computers'
motherboards, including graphics capabilities, a non-standard
bus for add-on equipment and a new version of the operating
system used on all IBM compatible computers.
     The word in (Silicon) Valley is that it will take two mln
dlrs and 18 months before the machines can be copied,'' said
Michael Murphy, publisher of the newsletter California
Technology Stock Letter.
      At the same time as Personal System is unveiled,
Microsoft Corp &lt;MSFT> is expected to unveil a new version of
its MS/DOS operating system, DOS 3.3, that will correct many of
the programming problems encountered on earlier versions of the
software. MS/DOS is used with all IBM personal computers.
      Consultants said that most existing IBM-compatible
software will run on the new computers but software written
specifically for the Personal System will not run on older
models.
     The industry will be looking closely at the delivery dates
for the new computers, particularly the 386, because if IBM
does not start shipping its entry in this important new market
soon, Compaq will continue to gain larger and larger market
share.
    Market researcher Future Computing Inc estimated that
Compaq's Deskpro 386, which started shipping last October, is
generating sales of between 3.5 mln and and four mln dlrs a
month. In the first six months of availability between 21 and
24 mln dlrs worth of Deskpro 386s were sold.
    Said Future Computing analyst Joe Cross, ""That's some
indication of the kind of money IBM is leaving on the table.""

    It said in a statement the appointments of the new members,
none of them previously involved in the insurance market, were

    Simultaneously, the number of outsiders would be increased

Lloyd's investors without an active role in the market, would
remain unchanged at eight.
 Lloyd's said the four newly-appointed Council members were
barrister Elizabeth Mary Freeman, Sir Maurice Hodgson,
non-executive chairman of British Home Stores Plc, Lloyd's Bank

who sat on the three-member Neill enquiry panel.

19949,LIMITED IMPACT SEEN FROM U.S. TAX ACCORD ACTION,"A U.S. decision ending a forty-year
tax treaty covering the Netherlands Antilles was unlikely to
have a major impact on the Eurobond market, tax experts said.
    Most U.S. firms stopped using financial subsidiaries
incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles to sell to the
Eurobond market in July, 1984, the experts said.
    But the decision affects Eurobonds issued before July 1984
involving principal worth an estimated 30 billion dlrs and will
probably mean those bonds will be called before their maturity
date, they said.
    Since most of the bonds are currently trading at a premium,
calling them in early will mean a loss in market value for the
bondholders, according to a Treasury official who asked not to
be identified.
    The official said the Treasury Department was currently
unsure about the impact of the move on the Eurobond market.
    ""We are monitoring the situation and receiving reports from
investors and issuers,"" the official said.
    Earlier, the Treasury said it notified the Netherlands of
the termination of the treaty effective January 1, 1988.
    For years, U.S. firms seeking to avoid a 30 pct withholding
tax used financial subsidiaries incorporated in the Netherlands
Antilles to sell Eurobonds, which are bonds issued abroad by an
overseas financial subsidiary.
    But most companies have since taken advantage of a 1984
change in the law known as the exemption for portfolio interest
that allows them to sell directly in the Eurobond market and
avoid the withholding tax.
    The 1984 tax change sharply reduced the number of U.S.
companies using the Netherlands Antilles to sell Eurobonds,
said Steven Hannes of accounting firm Touche Ross and Co.
    Ending the tax treaty will mean that some foreigners
investing in the U.S. through the Netherlands Antilles will
lose tax benefits and probably change their portfolios, Hannes
said.
    He said the decision would mainly affect foreign investors
who sought tax advantages because they reside in countries
which do not have a tax treaty with the United States.
    These investors typically reside in countries in the Middle
East, Central and South America, he said.
    Some of them may withdraw their U.S. investments or seek
tax relief through the Netherlands itself or Switzerland, but
the choices are limited, Hannes said.
    ""It is conceivable their investment may stay here. They
would bear some of the tax that has not been borne in the
past,"" Hannes said.
    U.S. domestic bonds are not affected by the change.
    U.S. companies with Eurobonds issued through the
Netherlands Antilles are expected to call them early to avoid
the tax liability, a Treasury Department spokesman said. But
they could refinance at lower rates because of the general
decline in interest rates, so the Department does not expect
U.S. firms to be hurt by the decision, the spokesman said.
Negotiations between the United States and the Netherlands
continued without success since the late 1970's. The
differences centered on U.S. concern over residents of third
countries avoiding U.S. taxes by using the treaty with the
Netherlands Antilles.

10704,BAHRAIN INTRODUCES NEW MONEY MARKET REGIME,"Bahrain is introducing a new domestic
money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on
the island's newly launched treasury bill programme.
    The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all
commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which
gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in
treasury bills, or through discounting them.
    The circular, released officially to Reuters, said current
arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be
valid except ""in quite exceptional circumstances.""
    Under the current system, the agency provides the island's
20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term
swaps against U.S. Dollars and, less frequently, by short-term
loans secured against government development bonds.
    ""The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace
these operations with short-term assistance based on Government
of Bahrain treasury bills,"" the circular to banks states.
    The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a
simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a
higher price which will reflect an interest charge.
    The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will
normally be for a period of seven days.
    Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of
91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since
raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme.
    Bahrain's commercial banks are currently liquid and have
been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered
by the agency. But banking sources said the new regime from
April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury
bills in case they need funds from the central bank.
    Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold
treasury bills, although the need by others to take up paper
could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted
yields slightly.
    Last week's yield was six pct, although the programme had
started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct.
    Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through
repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar
swaps. But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would
foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying
treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord.

903,PHILIPPINE PLANNING CHIEF URGES PESO DEVALUATION,"The Philippines must devalue the peso if
it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning
Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.

more competitive,"" Monsod said an interview. ""No question about
it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South
Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies
deliberately undervalued their currencies.""
    The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is
currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does
not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and
able to continue to respond to market conditions.
    Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from
the point of view of finance. ""If the dollar rate goes higher,
our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the
financing is very difficult,"" she said. ""But I am looking at it
in terms of the economy.""
    She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.
    ""I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to
become uncompetitive because then we are dead.""
    Monsod said, ""The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is
a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates)
of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic
thing.""
    Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct
in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was
expected to touch five pct this year.
    He said the government and the International Monetary Fund
had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.
    The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the

    ""I think we will maintain our buying power... I do not think
it will fall,"" Chirac told a radio interviewer yesterday. Last
year French household buying power rose 2.9 pct.
    Chirac said economic growth would be substantially lower
than originally forecast but investment would rise by close to

decline in the previous four-year period.

6720,HOUSE FARM LEADER SEES BILLION DLR BUDGET CUTS,"The 1988 agriculture budget will
have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the
chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the
use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are
possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending,
said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture
subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains.
    Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and
Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the
House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have
to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion
dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.
    Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be
made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988
budget, Glickman added.
    Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's 
proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.
    ""The administration's target price proposals are dead in
the water,"" he said.
    To cut the budget, Glickman said, ""everthing is on the
table,"" except those moves that would reduce farmers' income.
    Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee
will study in order to cut farm spending.
    Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and
1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he
said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.
    Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or ""pik')
certificates will also be another option his committee will
study, Glickman said.
    While not committing himself for or against such action, he
said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which
indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.
    Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and
tightening up of the person definition for annual payment
limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.
    He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by
five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move
that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would
not be in favor of such a change.
    Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's,
EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being
used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand
this program while making cuts in other areas.
    Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said.
    ""I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping
block,"" Glickman said.

Australia Ltd>, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares
in the Philippine brewing firm &lt;San Miguel>, a Manila newspaper
reported.
    The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to
President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander
Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct
of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the
government.
    The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in
Manila were not available for comment on the report.
    The shares are the entire block seized by the government
from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that
the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of
San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president
Ferdinand Marcos.
    The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14
mln class B shares.
    Government officials have said earlier that the more
valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners.
    The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at
which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might
buy eight mln class A shares last week.
    ""Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the
Philippines' yearly budget,"" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo
Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.
    ""Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his
corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so
that the company's assets can be fully utilised.""
    San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one of
the major manufacturers of grocery lines.
    Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap
food and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, the
U.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through &lt;Barwon Farmlands Ltd>,

14878,IAE CALLS OFF SUPERFAN ENGINE PROJECT,"The five-nation &lt;International Aero
Engine> (IAE) consortium has decided not to go ahead with the
proposed launch of its Superfan engine, a spokesman for
consortium member &lt;Rolls-Royce Plc> said.
    He said a group board meeting had concluded that a launch
would have been premature given the risks involved in trying to
meet an availability date of Spring, 1992 required by airlines.
    However, he added that the project had not been cancelled
and could be offered later on.
    The engine was originally proposed for fitting on the
&lt;Airbus Industrie> A340.
    IAE's members are Rolls, United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N>
Pratt and Whitney, Fiat SpA &lt;FIAT.MI> &lt;Japanese Aero Engines
Corp> and &lt;MTU> of West Germany.
    Airbus said this week it would switch to the Franco-U.S.
CFM-56-S3 alternative because of doubts whether the Superfan
would be ready on time.
    Rolls, which has been state-owned since 1971, launches its
""pathfinder"" prospectus giving preliminary details of its public
flotation later today.
    Analysts said that the timing of the postponement of
Superfan -- an 30,000 pound thrust upgrade of the consortium's
V2500 engine fitted to the A320 -- was embarrassing but should
not be considered a serious blow. If anything, it indicated the
financial prudence of the group, one added.
    The Rolls spokesman added that the decision did not affect
the V2500 programme itself. Equally, there was the possibility
that the consortium would go ahead with the Superfan later on.
    Rolls RB211 engine was not available for fitting to early

1927,HAWKE SEES FOUR BILLION DLR BUDGET DEFICIT,"Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and
Treasurer Paul Keating said the government's 1986/87 Budget
deficit could hit four billion dlrs against the official
forecast of 3.5 billion.
    Hawke told a Sydney radio station the deficit ""may turn out
at four billion."" He and Keating last week warned that the
budget deficit was running above target and vowed sharp
decisions on spending in a May 14 economic statement.
    A four billion dollar Budget deficit would be in line with
private economists' forecasts and compares with a 1985/86
shortfall of 5.73 billion dlrs.
    Hawke said the 1986/87 deficit would be equal to 1.5 pct of
forecast Gross Domestic Product against five pct when he took
office during the 1982/83 year.
    ""In money terms (the deficit has been reduced) from the 9.6
billion dlrs that we inherited ... Down to about 3.6 billion,
it may turn out at four billion dlrs,"" Hawke said.
    In a separate interview Keating said: ""The deficit for this
year, projected, was 3.5 billion .... It is in fact running ...
Over four billion and we will be trying to bring that in close
to target.""

15103,"J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING","J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
first three months of 1986.
    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
dlrs in the year-earlier period.
    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
underwriting of Euromarket securities.
    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
personnel costs, Morgan said.

17396,LOWER MARK RATE SPECULATION NOT SHARED IN GERMANY,"Speculation abroad that the
Bundesbank will steer money market rates lower, opening the
for interest rate cuts around Europe, is not shared by many
economists and money market dealers within Germany.
    Speculation has developed that the Bundesbank would
engineer lower rates to take pressure off the dollar/mark.
    A strong rise in U.S. Market rates this month, prompting
speculation the Fed would raise its 5-1/2 pct discount rate,
has raised the question whether Germany and Japan would also
broaden interest rate differentials to support the dollar.
    The U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is the key to the interest
rate outlook, money market dealers in Paris said.
    Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could take
pressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said.
    Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if the
trade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said.
    But if no solution is found, the Paris dealers said, a
renewed dollar fall would put strains on the mark/French franc
rate and force the Bank of France to raise short-term rates.
    The three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate rose to six pct
this week from 5.6 pct at the start of April, and the yield on
the 30-year benchmark treasury bonds rose this week in Tokyo to
a 14-month high of 8.86 pct from 7.66 pct in late March.
    The dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above
140 yen, underpinned by higher U.S. Rates and the Fed discount
rate speculation.
    But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which would
put pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates.
    Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said yesterday
the U.S. Had requested Japan to cut short-term interest rates.
    The Bank of Japan was making efforts to do this, he said,
adding the U.S. Had not asked for a cut in Japan's 2.5 pct
discount rate, a move which Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi
Sumita said was not under consideration.
    A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch central
bank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bank
favoured a cut in West German interest rates and would follow
suit if it happened.
    Citibank AG said in its April report that another expected
phase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut key
money market rates in the next three to six months.
    The Bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct on
repurchase pacts since February, with call money trading around
3.70 pct for much of April.
    Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reid
said the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further,
either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interest
rate, allowing the market to set the rate.
    ""I'm fairly confident we'll see lower rates,"" he said.
    Reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase rate
would have little impact on the German economy or fundamental
exchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions.
    ""A cut in German rates wouldn't be bad for the dollar, but I
think its effect would be limited in duration unless it was
accompanied by other measures elsewhere,"" he said.
    Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad that
the Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said the
Bundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at the
moment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month.
    The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to an
interest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month. That
should not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however,
they said.
    The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest
rate tenders, following the introduction of a new system to
speed up the tender process at the start of April, they said.
    Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at the
DIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said the
Bundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts.
    ""I don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little
it would stop a wave of (currency) speculation,"" he said. But a
sharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the
Bundesbank to take some action, he said.
    Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut in
interest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth.
    Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that the
monetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather
than credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate response
to excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to make
the mark and mark investments less attractive.
    Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors
would switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, which
have swollen central bank money stock, into securities, which
would take them out of the Bundesbank's key monetary measure.
    A cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead
investors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next
move would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buying
bonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen.
    There are so far no signs that German investors are
switching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbank
hopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank
economist Hermann Remsperger said.
    But Phillips and Drew's Reid said prospects of lower rates
and a strong currency would attract foreign investors into
German bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors.
    Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland
in Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates would
continue to drift lower in many European countries.
    ""The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britain
but more limited in West Germany, where we could see some
consolidation,"" he said. Switzerland could be forced to match
any cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising further
against the mark, he said.
    Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut in
U.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the
pound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising.

set up a distribution system to ensure the people in most need
can get Retrovir, the first drug shown to have activity against
AIDS, during an initial period while supplies of the drug are
limited.
    At a press conference here, Paul Dreyer, the company's
product manager for the drug, said physicians must submit an
enrollment application to the company for each new patient who
is a candidate for taking the drug.
    The company is the U.S. arm of Wellcome Plc.
    The application will list several items required to
evaluate a patient. The company will inform doctors within one
week if a patient meets enrollment criteria and whether there
are sufficient amounts of the drug available.
    On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the
drug for wide clinical use. The drug is not a cure for AIDS,
but it does prolong the lives of certain people with AIDS, who
have a history of certain types of pneumonia, and patients with
an advanced form of AIDS-related complex whose immune systems
have declined after infection with the virus.
    The company said it only has enough supply of the drug to
treat 15,000 patients and by the end of the year should have
enough supply to treat 30,000 patients.
    Dreyer said physicians can call 1-800-843-9388 for
information about distribution of the drug, and pharmacists can
call 1-800-322-1887 to place orders for the drug.
    Dreyer added this distribution system will end once an

20095,INDONESIA SAYS IT WILL EXTEND OIL CONTRACTS,"Indonesia told the oil industry on
Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and
improve the investment climate, but wants to see increased
expenditure on exploration in return.
    President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
    ""In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
production sharing contracts under the present laws,"" Suharto
said.
    ""Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
the petroleum industry,"" he said.
    Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
    ""As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
aware of this situation,"" Subroto said.
    ""The government has already made the political decision to
entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
selective basis.""
    Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
industry sources say.
    Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
deep water conditions.
    But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
that the oil price had recovered.
    President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
industry for the regions in which companies operated.
    Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
1986.
    Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
contracts with foreign oil companies.
    Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
operations was a government priority. There had been
misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
    He said the government wanted to finalise contract
extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
    Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.""
    Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
    Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
    Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
would be selective, based on how much capital would be
invested.

    Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.

the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits
with Taiwain and Korea.
    ""An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports

surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and
with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend
the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that
country.

11770,REAGAN SETS FIRM RULES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY STAFF,"President Reagan made public a
detailed set of orders to his national security staff designed
to prevent scandals similar to the Iran arms affair.
    In a message to Congress accompanying National Security
Decision Directive (NSDD) 266, Reagan said: ""(The reforms) are
evidence of my determination to return to proper procedures,
including consultation with the Congress.""
    NSDDs are normally classified. Officials said this was the
first time the duties of the national security staff had been
spelled out in such a document since the National Security
Council (NSC) was set up by Congress 40 years ago.
    The orders implement the recommendations of the Tower
Commission, named by the president to investigate the secret
U.S. Arms sales to Iran and led by former Senator John Tower.
    In a scathing report on February 26, the panel blasted the
conduct of the NSC staff and criticised the president for being
unaware of many of the activities of his subordinates.
    Reagan accepted the report's conclusions in a speech on
March 4 and said he had barred NSC staff from conducting covert
operations. The prohibition is laid out in NSDD 266 which calls
for a ""small, highly competent (NSC staff) broadly experienced
in the making of national security policy.""
    NSDD 266 said the organization should impose ""clear vertical
lines of control and accountability.""
    The eight page document said the NSC's use of private
individuals and organisations as intermediaries to conduct
covert activities would be ""appropriately limited and subject to
close observation.""
    It said the NSC staff should include a legal adviser who
would have access to all information. The national security
adviser should initiate periodic reassessments of policies and
operations and ensure that consultations and presidential
decisions are adequately recorded, it said.

TF-1, which is in the process of being privatised, should
achieve a profit of around 25 francs per share next year after
several years of losses, but will not make a profit this year,
the new TF-1 president Francis Bouygues said.
    Interviewed on TF-1 on the eve of the public flotation of
40 pct of the channel's equity, Bouygues said ""in 1988 we have
to make a profit, and we will make a profit.""
    ""I envisage per share profits of 25 francs,"" he said. ""I am
very optimistic.""

    Bouygues said exceptional costs associated with the
restructuring of the station would prevent a profit this year.

crude sugar production during the harvest would be ""less than

    The harvest was plagued by a four year shortfall of rain
which reduced the sugar content of the cane and by unseasonable
rain storms during the first two months of this year which made
cane cutting by mechanical combines virtually impossible.

this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European
Community levels, director-general of the INFE export
institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.
    ""The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic
Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now,"" he
said.
     ""This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there
is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy,
which have a similar productive structure,"" he said.
    The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other
fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in
international trade fairs.
    Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as
traditional industrial exports will be promoted.
    Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20
billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the
government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special
25 billion peseta grant.
    The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in
real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.
    Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in
developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand,
which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.
    He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries.
    The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the
Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to
concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.
    ""The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are
vital to survival in the context of EC competition,"" he said.
    He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the
domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while
turning their backs on foreign markets.

16198,FURTHER WEAKNESS SEEN IN TOKYO STOCKS IN NEAR TERM,"Tokyo share prices are expected to weaken
further for about a week, following a sharp drop which at one
time today saw the Nikkei Dow index down 571.01 points in
mid-afternoon trading, brokers said.
    They said uncertainty caused by disputes between Japan and
its main trading partners will continue to deter investors from
equities.
    The market index, which closed the day 297.05 points down
at 22,919.54, will probably end the present downturn at around
22,300 points, brokers predicted.
    ""This is just a short-term correction and the market will
probably end up at about 22,300 in about a week's time,"" said a
broker at Nomura Securities Co.
    He said that today's late recovery from afternoon lows
showed that investors were still hunting bargains in
anticipation of an upturn.
    Brokers reiterated expectations of an imminent cut in
Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate, a factor seen to be diverting
money from bank accounts into stocks and boosting the market.
    Securities company, bank and insurance issues, likely to
benefit from a rate cut, were bought in late trading.
    The Nomura broker said he expects the rate cut in May or
June, after Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's scheduled visit
to Washington on April 29. Nakasone is expected to seek an end
to Japanese-U.S. Trade disputes which are hurting investor
confidence.
    ""Until we see some concerted effort by the Japanese to halt
the yen's rise against the dollar and settle trade disputes,
the market will stay low,"" said head of equities at Jardine
Fleming Securities Co, Mario Malt.
    Malt said current talks between the countries were
inflammatory and damaged stockmarket optimism.
    Brokers also said that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party has to show it still rules, after Sunday's nationwide
local elections showed dwindling support.
    ""It raises doubts on whether the LDP can push through the
reforms it planned for this year,"" said one broker.
    Top policy priorities this year are deregulation of
financial activities, stimulation of domestic demand to boost
imports and removal of agricultural subsidies.
    If these policies are abandoned or scaled down, stockmarket
investors will have few reasons to buy stocks, brokers said.

steel exports to the United States, now limited because of
tough import restraints set in 1984 by the Reagan

    Brazilian and U.S. Trade officials held the first of a

the U.S. Government reached accords with seven steel-exporting
nations - Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa
and South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United
States by about 30 pct in 1985.
    The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil's
steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes,
increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in
1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.

4824,NEW RUBBER PACT APPEARS IN THE BALANCE,"Negotiations on a new International
Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the
make-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear to
be in the balance, delegates said.
    Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA
renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small
group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major
outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said
those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to
allow time to draft an agreement during the second week.
    The talks are due to last until March 20.
    Xuto said, ""There is nothing concrete yet, but the
atmosphere is good."" The discussions are expected to continue
late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend
meetings.
    Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to
which price adjustments should be automatic.
    At present, if the market price has been above or below the
reference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo
in the current agreement) for six months, the reference price
is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the
International Natural Rubber Organisation council.
    Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the
adjustment be automatic at five pct or more.
    Producers want the council to have the last word and have
resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure.
    Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling
another issue -- that of the floor price.
    It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their
insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called
the ""lower indicative price,"" under certain circumstances.
    This means that any possible compromise would centre on the
reference price, and the ""may buy"" (or ""may sell"") and ""must buy"" or
""must sell"" levels, without changing the ""lower indicative price""
-- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the current
pact.
    Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on
the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to
another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at
12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.

to take measures to ensure that Japanese exports expected to be
effectively excluded from the U.S. Market from today are not
diverted to the EC, a spokesman said.
    President Reagan is expected to announce later today the
imposition of 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese
goods ranging from computers and television sets to power tools
and photographic film.
    The spokesman for the EC executive Commission said
representatives of member states last Friday agreed a series of
measures to prevent Tokyo deflecting exports to the EC.
    The spokesman declined to detail the measures, saying they
were technical, and the Commission would decide their precise
content depending on the exact details of the measures
announced by Reagan.
    The EC fears Tokyo will step up exports to it of a range of
products including calculating machines, measuring instruments,
small televisions, tapes and some machine tools as a result of
the U.S. Measures.
    But the spokesman said there was thought to be ample time
to put the countermeasures in place after the Easter holiday.
    He noted the probable outline of Reagan's announcement and
its date have been known for some time.
    The Japanese manufacturers of goods likely to be affected
by the announcement are thought to have been stepping up their
exports to the United States in recent weeks in order to beat
the April 17 deadline, he noted.
    They were therefore unlikely to have stocks available for
export to the EC immediately, he said.

to underwrite more 10-year bonds from April. Four U.S. Banks
are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April
to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they
hold no more than 50 pct of the capital, bankers said.
    These firms are likely to join the syndicate, which will
increase the number of participants in the 10-year government
bond primary market, securities managers said.
    Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the
syndicate underwrites 0.07 pct of each issue, they said.
    In order to expand participation by foreigners, the
syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct
share or introduce auctions to the primary market, they said.
    Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate, now
Fuji Bank Ltd, to increase their share to 30.7 pct but banks
oppose any cut in their 74 pct share, bankers said.

19110,SAUDI OIL RESERVES RISE DESPITE HIGHER OUTPUT,"Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi
Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.
    Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167
billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
    Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about
200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.

    Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed
from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
organisation decided to cut production again from last
September onwards.
    Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
    Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
official Saudi Press Agency.
    The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.

    Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44
mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was
upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the
report said.
    The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by
another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced
around 750,000 bpd last year.

    Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began
operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes
per day, the report said.
    Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4
billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.

3111,U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE,"The Bank of England said it was taking
onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct
Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on
application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct
and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the
remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the
bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free
of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated
8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 ""B.""  A further 100 mln stg was
reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.
    The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's
announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08
quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20
minutes after the news.
    Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the
backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates
which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of
sterling's strength.
    The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to
see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon
announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11
pct.
    The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate
cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay
a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March
17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.
    However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable
climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and
allow a half-point cut.
    Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market
as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early
rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.
    Most market participants believe that Lawson will now
foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time
of the budget, although one or two said they would not be
surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.
    Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts
last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued
a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the
Government bond market.
    To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold
out within hours of becoming available for trading and the
market pushed on to register further sharp gains.
    Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the
issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as
rapidly as last week's.
    However, they noted that although sterling had edged down
from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed
on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final
71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300
GMT.

member was exceeding oil production quotas allocated by the
13-nation group.
    Sheikh Ali told Kuwait's daily al-Anba ""All OPEC states,

them. Some of them are producing less.""
    Some oil industry sources had said the United Arab
Emirates, which had been generally been producing over its

pumping more than its allotted amount in the first months of
this year.
    Ecuador had also publicly stated it was over its quota, but
an earthquake early this month stopped that. Iraq has rejected
its quota, but oil sources say it may be having problems
marketing at official prices all the oil it wants to sell.

4026,U.S. HOUSE PANEL TAKES FIRST TRADE BILL VOTES,"House trade lawmakers took their
first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but
held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on
controversial plans to protect American industries.
    Meeting in closed session, the House Ways and Means Trade
Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues
in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading
partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United
States.
    The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of
Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open
foreign markets but which drops last year's effort to force
President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs.
    Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the
lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will
consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting
specific trade penalties.
    The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and
Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it.
    Rep. Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who is seeking
his party's 1988 presidential nomination, said he may offer an
amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of
those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods.
    This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to
force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus
with the United States by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, West
Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances.
    ""My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for
getting the trade deficit down,"" he told reporters.
    The trade law changes are to become part of a major
congressional and administration effort to turn around the
record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by
opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more
competitive.
    House Speaker James Wright, a Texas Democrat, said again
today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by
May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill.
    ""I expect whatever is reported (by the Ways and Means
Committee) will pass. We will have a good bill and an effective
bill,"" he told reporters.
    The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other
committees to ease export controls on high technology, to aid
U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition, to stimulate
research and development, to remove foreign trade barriers and
to improve education and worker training.
    The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S.
industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition
if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining,
safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the
country's economic development.
    They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to
retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and
whether an injured industry deserves import relief.
    They agreed to make it easier for a company to get
temporary relief from import competition but agreed the
industry should provide a plan to become competitive.
    The administration has not announced its support but
Yeutter said yesterday, ""I am cautiously optimistic,"" that the
Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill.

    Some 3,000 members of the United Auto Workers at GM's
Livonia, Mich., parts plant will vote in two shifts on a local
contract to replace their current agreement with the company,
according to officials of both the union and the company.
    The proposed accord would initiate the so-called ""team
concept"" at the plant, which makes seat cushions and is part of
GM's Inland Division.
    Under the proposed contract, workers in one area of the
plant would be responsible for the entire product and would
make some of their own decisions about assembling that product,
said Kevin Woodward, a steward with the UAW local that
represents the workers.
    An Inland division spokesman would not discuss details of
the accord. But he said Inland has a ""serious"" capacity
problem.
    No wage or benefit issues are in the proposal. Those issues
are covered by a national pact between GM and the UAW. Talks on
a new national accord are expected to begin in July.
    If the contract is ratified, it would go into effect as
soon as the vote count is completed, said Ronald Catcher, a
member of the local's executive board.

contract, he said.

new accord. ""It's going to be close either way,"" he said.

8606,WORLD BANK CHIEF PLEDGES SUPPORT TO INDONESIA,"World Bank president Barber Conable
pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower
world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its
protected economy was needed.
    Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,
he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the
economy and deregulate trade policy.
    Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which
cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third
World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs
from the World Bank in the past 20 years.
    Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300
mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was
prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to
lower oil and primary commodity prices.
    ""We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are
consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,"" he
said.
    He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last
year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the
difficulties now faced by other countries.
    Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the
dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and
has announced a series of measures since May intended to
stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise
the economy.
    However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics
and high tariff barriers remain in place.
    Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met
14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's
borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the
country.

5127,TRADING RANGE LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN DEBT FUTURES,"U.S. economic data due out next week is
unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest
rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of
the last 3-1/2 months, financial analysts said.
    ""People don't seem to have any firm conviction about the
current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve
doing anything,"" said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman
Mains.
    The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading
volume, he noted. ""We've had a decline in activity as recent
economic statistics have not greatly changed people's
viewpoints on interest rates,"" Mains said.
    The data, which has provided not clear-cut view of the
economy, coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange
markets after the Paris initiative has made for ""less than
ebullient market action,"" Mains said.
    He added, however, that Treasury bond futures could be in
for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the
top of the trading range.
    ""My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and
market participants will see that current prices are
unjustified,"" Mains said.
    Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted
that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks
retail interest. ""All of the movement occurs at the opening,""
afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades, Connery said.
    Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond
prices, the small rise in February producer prices and downward
revisions in January retail sales and industrial production
were ""not real exciting,"" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred
Leiner.
    ""There is no one factor that will push us through the highs
at this moment,"" Leiner said.
    Next week's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national
Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market,
said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan.
Still, forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the
direction of bond prices over the next month.
    Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is
around three pct, due largely to a buildup in inventories
reflected in the January inventory data Friday, which showed
the largest increase since 1979.
    ""The key question will be not whether there is a large
increase in first quarter GNP, but whether any increase is
sustainable or a one shot deal,"" Kahan said.
    He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP
stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on
second quarter growth.
    If that is the case, GNP in the second quarter could ease
back to a one to two pct growth rate, Kahan said.

17277,U.S. MAY TELL JAPAN SANCTIONS CAN END - NY TIMES,"President Reagan is expected to tell
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the U.S. May be
able to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June,
the New York Times said.
    The newspaper, quoting administration officials, said that
under such a scenario the President would announce just before
the June 8-10 economic summit meeting in Venice that he hoped
to lift the restrictions on electronics imports by the end of
the month. Japan, for its part, would have to show that it had
stopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in
Japan for U.S. Chip producers.
    The U.S. Administration imposed 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln
dlrs worth of Japanese color television sets, motorised tools
and personal computers on April 17.
    Japanese officials have said Nakasone's main demand when he
arrives for talks with Reagan on Wednesday would be the
immediate lifting of the tariffs.
    But with Congress planning further trade reprisals against
Japanese trade policies, the end-of-June timeframe is seen as
the best Reagan can offer, the Times said. It said some verbal
formulation was expected to be found in a communique that would

    Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial average closed above

Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this
year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth
disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.
    The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the
EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC
veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.
    The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has
already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to
bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy
industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export
revenue.
    ""The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally
when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of
beef exports,"" one industry source said yesterday.
     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, ""Depending on the
seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then
decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting
beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension
on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are
still awaiting their decision,"" he added, asking not to be
identified.
    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of
high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had
spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and
upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.
    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be
forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low
prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales
could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.

11000,PARIS MEET AGREED NOT TO PUBLISH BANDS - LAWSON,"U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in
Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection
with their pact to stabilise currencies.
    Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why
the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson
replied, ""we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.""
When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float
with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said ""I do not
want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not
to make it easy for"" speculation against the accord.
    Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual
countries would take corrective action if their currency began
reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.
    But if such movements were due to extraneous factors,
Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid
through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.
    ""It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having
difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate
appreciations and making their economies more domestically
oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to
make its own economy more export oriented,"" Lawson said.
    In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury
Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's
current level, adding that ""It is an objective ... To try to
keep it around that level.""
    He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had
changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the
pound had weathered that period so successfully. ""There has been
a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals,"" Lawson said.  He
disagreed with what he termed ""the grossly exaggerated claim""
that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of
other major industrialsed countries.
    Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank
rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real
interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and
only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average.
    Lawson confirmed that ""over the medium and longer term, the
government's objective is zero inflation.""
    He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at
1.0 pct of GDP ""is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget
doctrine.""  He added that ""to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain
constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply
a recipe for accelerating inflation.""

4422,FARM CREDIT LOSS PUT AT 900 MLN FIRST HALF 1987,"A member of the board which
regulates the Farm Credit System predicted the troubled farm
lender may lose about 900 mln dlrs in the first half of 1987,
hastening the need for a federal rescue this year.
    Speaking to the House subcommittee responsible for farm
credit issues, Farm Credit Administration (FCA) board member
Jim Billington said ""My recommendation is that legislation
(aiding the system) must be moved prior to June, 30, 1987, or
it will be difficult to close the (farm credit system) books.""
    Billington's loss prediction is gloomier than either the
system or its regulator had previously admitted.
    The system itself has so far predicted losses for all of
1987 will reach only 1.1 billion dlrs, down from 1.9 billion in
1986 and 2.7 billion in 1985.
    However, Billington said the system is losing in excess of
400 mln dlrs per quarter, implying total losses for 1987 of
more than 1.6 billion.
    Losses of that magnitude would exhaust the 1.4 billion dlrs
in capital surplus the system held at the end of 1986.
    The system also has 4.2 billion dlrs in capital held by its
member borrowers, called borrower stock, which theoretically
could be used as capital.
    Billington said by the end of 1987, more than 1.6 billion
dlrs of the 4.2 billion in borrower stock would be downgraded
in value because of the mounting losses.
    Chairman of the FCA board, Frank Naylor, urged that
Congress begin to consider legislation rescuing the system by
Easter and that a bill be completed by the fall.
    Chairman of the House subcommittee, Rep. Ed Jones,
(D-Tenn.) said today ""the time has arrived to consider
assistance to save the system.""
    The Senate Democratic leadership indicated last month that
it would begin drafting a bailout bill by Easter.
    FCA board members differed on whether a direct government
infusion of cash will be needed to rescue the system. FCA
chairman Naylor said a federal guarantee of both borrower stock
and system bonds held by investors might avoid the need to
provide ""hard capital"" to the system.
    However, Billington said ""its not really that simple, in my
opinion,"" adding that government funds may be needed to rescue
the system.
    Neither regulator estimated how much money might be needed.

246,QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88,"The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering
slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,
announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a
deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.
    The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals
in the last published budget for 1985/86.
    In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year
1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh
Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to
spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.
    Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6
billion riyals.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about
6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86
projected revenue of 9.7 billion.
    The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to
uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government
decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to
one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15
pct.
    He urged heads of government departments and public
institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He
did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in
1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on
the country's foreign reserves.
    He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been
allocated for major projects including housing and public
buildings, social services, health, education, transport and
communications, electricity and water, industry and
agriculture.
    No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and
security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.
    Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000
barrels per day.
    Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: ""Our expectations of positive signs
regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's
determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its
wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming
year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.""

12654,NIGERIAN NAIRA FIRMS AFTER RULE CHANGE,"The Nigerian naira firmed  against the
dollar, banking sources said, after the rules governing foreign
exchange auctions at the central bank were changed.
    The marginal rate set at today's auction, from which
reporters were barred for the first time since the sessions
began last September, was 3.7001 to the dollar compared with
4.0002 at the last session on March 19, the sources said.
    Under the new system unveiled on March 20 and in operation
for the first time today, bidding banks must pay for foreign
exchange at the rate they bid, rather than as previously at the
rate of the lowest successful bid.
    The measure was aimed at discouraging banks from bidding
high and thus driving down the naira's value. But banking
sources and other analysts said demand for foreign exchange
remained sharply higher than the available funds.
    Henceforth the sessions will be held every fortnight,
instead of weekly, and today only 80 mln dlrs was on offer
compared with the 50 mln dlrs usually on sale each week.
    The rule change appeared to have an immediate impact on
bids. Today's highest bid was 4.06 to the dollar, compared with
a top bid of 4.25 two weeks ago.
    Banks who bid higher than the marginal rate will be able to
pass on their rate to their customers, while the marginal rate
will only act as a marker for transactions.

2197,"DUTCH GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW, JOBLESS RISE IN 1987","Leaks of a major Dutch official
economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate
reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this
year, political and market sources say.
    Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness
this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage
increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some
calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.
    But whatever the government's response, the central bank
will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.
    The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB)
publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will
also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and
the economy.
    Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate
reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch
economic growth was now seen around one pct.
    Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the
decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West
Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar,
Pierson said in its February economic outlook.
    The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct
growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of
2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.
    The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the
government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of
reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.
    Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central
bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if
necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.
    Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised
the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in
last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and
expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.
    But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy
had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the
dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.
    Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not
to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead
lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.
    Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move
saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on
the money market, noting ""the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the
moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already
far below the market rates.""
    Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of
the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest
rate policies serve that goal.
    Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands
recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold
to take profits.
    Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would
reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more
dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch
interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued
completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.
    Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision
not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson
warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.
    Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry
and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having
said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower
Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first.
    One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down
to reduce the government debt burden.
    A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were
needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between
the ministry and the central bank. ""The cabinet's policy is
steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,"" he said.

11275,CHINA GETS RARE CRITICISM AT PEOPLE'S CONGRESS,"Charges of public sector waste,
corruption and neglect of agriculture have surfaced amid the
compliments in debates at the annual session of China's
parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC).
    China's top entrepreneur Rong Yiren, chairman of the China
International Investment and Trust Corporation (CITIC), who
also represents Shanghai in the NPC, attacked the ""profit before
everything"" mentality which he said led to theft, embezzlement
and extravagant gifts and banquets.
    Public criticism of policy is rare in China.
    The New China News Agency quoted comments by NPC members on
Premier Zhao Ziyang's draft work program for the year ahead.
    The rural lobby was active. Deputies from three provinces
said Zhao was not forceful enough in tackling their problems.
One said the state had cut spending on agriculture from 11 pct
of total capital investment in 1979 to three or four pct today.
""This is incompatible with the important place occupied by
agriculture,"" he said.
    Other deputies said the state had broken promises to
improve fertiliser, oil and seed supplies to their provinces.
    Although another congress member was quoted by the agency
as saying Zhao's opening speech last week was ""discreet,
appropriate, comprehensive and assuring,"" others said the
government had spent too much or too little. One member said
people were worried about the state's budget deficit, projected
at more than two billion dlrs this year.

17212,CSR PLANS TAKEOVER BID FOR MONIER,"CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> said it plans to offer
3.50 dlrs a share cum-bonus for all the issued capital of
building products group Monier Ltd &lt;MNRA.S>.
    The offer values Monier's current issued capital of 156.28
mln shares at 547 mln dlrs and compares with the latest share
market price of 2.80 dlrs, equal to last Friday's close.
    Monier recently said it proposes to make a one-for-two
bonus issue before June 30.
    CSR will shortly announce further details of the offer
including a CSR share alternative, it said in a statement.
    CSR said it currently holds 323,000 Monier shares or only
0.21 pct of the company's issued capital.
    Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, the holder of 49.87 pct of Monier,
has agreed with CSR that Redland will not accept the offer for
its stake initially, CSR said.
    Instead, CSR has granted Redland two alternative options,
the first giving Redland the right to accept the CSR offer at
the same price within six months of the closing date of the
bid, the company said.
    The second grants Redland the option to increase its Monier
holding to 50.1 pct in the same period.
    The second option is exercisable by Redland at 3.50 dlrs a
share, CSR said.
    Both option deals are subject to the approval of Monier
shareholders except CSR and Redland.
    As previously reported, Redland and Monier had been
discussing a possible Redland bid for Monier but the talks
broke off two weeks ago.
    CSR said Redland supports the CSR offer as a means of
establishing a fruitful joint venture in building materials in
which they both have interests. At the end of the offer, they
will discuss how these interests may be developed.
    Redland has indicated that it would be prepared to consider
at a later stage an increase in CSR's Monier stake to enable it
to become a CSR subsidiary, assuming Redland exercises the
second option, CSR said.
    It said the offer is generous because it will give Monier
shareholders a price equivalent to 16.8 times after-tax
earnings in 1985/86 ended June 30, a 25 pct premium over
Friday's market price and a 125 pct premium over last reported

5887,SOUTH AMERICAN FISH MEAL PRODUCTION AT RECORD HIGH,"Production of fish meal by the three
South American producers -- Chile, Peru and Equador -- last
year reached 2.5 mln tonnes, equalling the record output of
1970, the International Association of Fish Meal Manufacturers
(IAFMM) said.
    However, IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chilean
and Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987
to be much lower than the 651,000 tonnes produced in the last
quarter of 1986, due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile for
the month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peru
in the same month.
    The statement added that, due to technical market promotion
and energetic sales by Chile and Peru, the stock position at
the end of the year remained reasonable.
    Fish meal production outside South America decreased
slightly, falling from 114,400 to 111,100 tonnes.
    The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in West
Germany, Scandinavian countries, Eastern Europe and the Far
East, but fell in the U.S. And remained static in the U.K.
    It added that fish meal consumption had suffered from
competition with feed grade tallow in the U.S. And with skimmed
milk powder in the U.K.

nations, in thousands of tonnes, were -

4373,MAGMA &lt;MGCPV> STOCK TRANSFERABILITY LIMITED,"Newmont Mining Corp &lt;NEM> said Magma
Copper Co's certificate of incorporation and by-laws have been
restated to limit the transferability of the company's stock.
    In an information statement on its decision to distribute
Magma stock as a dividend, Newmont said the changes ""will
impede any change of control of Magma.""
    It said this has been done by authorizing two closses of
common stock -- 60 mln class A shares with one vote each and
38.1 mln class B shares with four votes each. In the dividend
of one Magma share for each Newmont share outstanding announced
Tuesday, Class B shares are being distributed.
    Newmont is distributing 30,458,100 Magma shares, or 80 pct
of the Class B common, to its shareholders.
    It said this stock will be transferable as Class B stock
until one entity acquires over 10 pct of the shares.
    Any shares over 10 pct of those outstanding will
automatically be changed by the transfer agent to Class A
stock, Newmont said.
    The company said there are two exceptions under the bylaws
-- the 15 pct of Magma's stock it is retaining and the 21 pct
which will be held by &lt;Consolidated Gold Fields PLC> as a
result of its ownership of that portion of Newmont.
    However, Newmont Secretary Roger Adams said, any additional
Magma shares acquired by Newmont or Consolidated will
automatically become Class A shares.
    None of the authorized Class A shares is being distributed
at this point, Newmont said.
    The company also said five pct of Magma's stock is being
held in trust for members of Magma's management.
    Newmont said Magma's restated certificate of incorporation
also limits change in control of the company by dividing the
board into three classes serving staggered terms.
    Newmont said the new Magma rules also provide that
shareholder action can be taken only at shareholder meetings,
prohibiting shareholder action by written consent, and include
""fair price"" provisions limiting combinations with any holder
of more than 10 pct of Magma's voting power.

3027,TECHNOLOGY/NEW ERA FOR INFORMATION HANDLING,"Ground-breaking new systems for storing
and retrieving information are ushering in a new era for
computer companies and computer users.
    Within the past few weeks, International Business Machines
Corp &lt;IBM>, Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK> and others have launched
products that radically increase the amount of data that can be
catalogued and shelved in computerized libraries.
    ""This flurry of new technology could yield systems that
handle a multimedia blitz of data,"" said Ian Warhaftig, a
senior analyst with International Data Corp, Framingham, Mass.
    ""We're developing new systems because our customers are
asking for them,"" Peter Giles, vice president and general
manager of Kodak's mass memory division, said in a recent
interview.
    This demand is expected to soar in coming years. While
estimates vary, industry analysts project that providing
products and services geared for information storage and
retrieval could become a 20 billion dlr a year business by
1995.
    A wide range of technologies will be needed to meet the
varying requirements of users.
    For example, a large credit verification service would want
a system from which it could quickly retrieve credit data and
relay it to its clients. A law firm, however, may need a
computerized law library in which capacity, rather than speed,
is the key feature. For architects and engineers, the ability
to store photographs, sketches and other graphics would be
crucial.
    Regardless of the specific application, the trend is toward
converting information - documents, video or film or even sound
recordings - into to the digital language of zeros and ones
understood by computers.
    Saving space is the key goal in digitizing data for
storage. An optical disk the size of a standard compact disk
can store 550 megabytes of data, or about 250,000 pages of
typewritten text.
    For this reason, the compact disk read-only memory, or
CD-ROM, is already a popular data storage media. Last week,
Microsoft introduced Microsoft Bookshelf, a 300 dlr program
that contains, on a single CD-ROM disk, a dictionary,
thesaurus, national ZIP code directory, Bartlett's Familiar
Quotations, the World Almanac and other reference works.
    Scores of such products are already on the market, but most
are specialty items, such as Lotus Development Corp's &lt;LOTS>
CD-ROM data base of stock information for financial analysts
and investors. ""Microsoft Bookshelf is important because it
marks the arrival of CD-ROM packages for the general public,""
said Ian Warhaftig of International Data Corp.
    One drawback of the CD-ROM, which uses a laser to record
and read data, is that that it requires a special player.
CD-ROM players for the retail market will appear later this
year.
    Moreover, IDC's Warhaftig said CD-ROM's will be integrated
with personal computers.
    ""Eventually, CD-ROM's will fit right inside the PC box,"" he
said. ""Imagine the advantage of having a spelling checker and
thesaurus at your fingertips when you're writing with a word
processing program.""
    But CD-ROM's are just the beginning. Also last week, Kodak
unveiled several systems that use 12-inch optical disks. The
largest Kodak system uses a jukebox-like cabinet to hold up to
150 optical disks from which data can be retrieved in a matter
of seconds.
    Kodak also announced a 14-inch optical disk with 6.8
gigabytes of memory, five times the memory of a CD-ROM. The
Kodak disk, which will not be available until the middle of
1988, is designed for users who need quick access to very large
amounts of data, said Kodak's Giles.
    Meanwhile, N.V. Philips &lt;PGLO.AS>, the Dutch electronics
giant, is preparing to take optical disk technology a step
further with the first disk that can combine text, video and
sound. Philips said the system, called Called CD-Interactive,
will be ready next year. It will include a new kind of CD-ROM
player that can hook up with a television set and stereo.
     Additional breakthroughs are expected as the next
generation of computer memory chips are introduced. Last month
IBM said it has made a four-megabyte chip, capable of storing
more data than eight CD-ROM's. Meantime, &lt;Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone> of Japan said it has built a 16-megabyte chip.
    Analysts say commercial versions of these chips are several
years away, though some suspect that IBM may start volume
production of its four-megabyte chip sometime this year.
    Such chips will enable computer makers to build computers
with immense memory capacities.

2156,WRIGHT SAYS TAX RISE NEEDED TO CUT U.S. DEFICIT,"House Speaker James Wright said
President Reagan should realize that there will be no way to
meet the deficit reduction targets in the 1988 budget without a
tax increase.
    ""In my judgment there isn't any way to achieve the commanded
reductions in the deficit without some additional revenue,"" the
Texas Democrat told reporters before the opening of the House
session.
    Wright said the Democrats intended to make the additional
tax burden fairer than was Reagan's plan for 22 billion dlrs in
additional revenues in the 1988 budget.
    ""It's not a question of whether new revenue is needed, it's
a question of who has to pay,"" Wright said.
    He has opposed deficit reduction proposals included in
Reagan's budget which would raise fees on medicare recipients,
tax black lung benefits and reduce tax breaks for home
purchases.
    Wright has sought to delay the 1988 income tax rate cut but
has said other options such as a tax on securities transfers
were merely floated as possible deficit reduction alternatives.
    ""There has to be a recognition of reality,"" he said.

15447,EC LAUNCHES ANTI-DUMPING PROBE ON JAPANESE CHIPS,"The European Community launched an
investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese
semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark
an intensification of world trade strains.
    Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington
for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it
imports into the U.S.
    The EC Executive Commission said today the European
Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that
Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable
programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.
    Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM
market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been
forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in
order to compete with the Japanese.

sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an
investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found
the complaints were justified.

And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged

19005,"AUSTRALIA SET TO GROW, BUT UNEMPLOYMENT MAY RISE","Australia's economy should manage modest
growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but
unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross
Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct
in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be
helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand
following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.
    The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer
prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.
    The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly
and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
    While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,
however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth
forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.
    The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic
growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is
struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.
    The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,
should again show growth over the next two years, rising by
0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.

1940,TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT NEW HIGH,"Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a
new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared
with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year
earlier, the central bank said.
    Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase
came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion
U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and
March 4.
    He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because
Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade
surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.
    Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,
but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion
U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.
    In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct
on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.
Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus
with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2
billion, according to official statistics.
    Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is
planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half
of this year.
    The reserves could support imports of more than two years
for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the

17478,PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE,"Crude oil prices could remain around 18
dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on
output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.
    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of
international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared
to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
for the third quarter. ""Production is surging ahead of what was
originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
envisaged a few months ago,"" he said.
    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of
production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
envisaged might soften price levels.
    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in
Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.
    ""I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in
terms of volume decisions,"" Lajous said.
    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted
output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
always there as a possibility, he said.
    ""I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I
expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
discipline will be maintained,"" he said.
    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
1987 if output remains under control.
    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that
increased production was not so important as long as incomes
would not be affected by the output, were ""very relevant and
welcome from such a powerful producer.""

17018,CREATIVE MONETARY POLICY TO SPUR KUWAITI ECONOMY,"Kuwait, a major oil producer hit by last
year's price slump, is leaning towards a more creative monetary
policy to help spur its economy, banking sources said.
    ""There is a clear emphasis on encouraging the use of money
in productive ventures, rather than having it all tied up in
interest bearing investments which have no direct productive
outlet,"" one banker said.
    Kuwait's Central Bank yesterday cut one key money market
rate and abandoned another which had been used since February
1986 to direct inter-bank borrowing and lending costs.
    The bank reduced to six pct from 6-1/2 pct the rate at
which it will offer funds of one month to one year in the
inter-bank market. This, in turn, affected retail rates.
    The cut, the third this year, followed a major overhaul of
interest rate policy last month which Central Bank Governor
Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah said was designed to revive
the economy.
    One banker said ""There is growing flexibility, creativity,
in interest rate policy, amid an awareness of the need to
diversify the economy by stimulating the non-oil sector.""
    For the first time in nearly three years domestic interest
rates are now significantly below those for the U.S. Dollar, a
favourite haven for Gulf speculative and investor funds in the
past, banking sources said.
    Despite uncertainties generated by the 6-1/2 year old Iran-
Iraq war on Kuwait's northern doorstep, bankers play down the
prospect of any significant capital flight.
    The Kuwaiti dinar, whose value is set by the Central Bank
and was fixed today at 0.27095/129 to the dollar, is stronger
now than for several years.
    Fears that the dollar may fall further will prompt second
thoughts among Kuwaiti investors prepared to consider switching
funds into the U.S. Currency, the sources said.
    ""There is a distinct exchange rate risk,"" they added.
    Bankers said the dollar slump hurt many investors behind
the last major capital outflow in 1984, encouraged then by 18
pct U.S. Interest rates and the start of Iranian attacks on
neutral shipping in the Gulf.
    The Central Bank calculates its dinar exchange rate against
a basket of currencies. Bankers do not know the basket's exact
make-up but say it is weighted heavily in favour of the dollar.
    Some bankers believe any strengthening of the dinar beyond
0.27000 to the dollar might provoke investors into shifting
funds into the U.S. Currency. ""They may ask:When will the dollar
be so cheap again?"" one said.
    And with dinar interest rates now roughly one pct below
those for the dollar, they say the Central Bank faces a
delicate balancing role requiring further flexibility.
    Bankers said the current, expansionary interest rate policy
is only part of a broader attempt to encourage local investment
and strengthen the backbone of the economy.
    They estimate the economy, measured in terms of GDP and
allowing for inflation, shrank 19 pct in 1986 after an 8.1 pct
contraction the previous year.
    Bankers also noted recent measures to stimulate stock
market activity, capped today by sharp cuts in brokerage fees
to make it cheaper for investors to trade.

    The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy
would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the

approved a plan to seek negotiations with other industrialized
countries for the purchase of developing country debt from
commercial banks.
    The plan is expected to face opposition in the full House
Banking Committee where approval must be obtained to send it on

    Under their plan, Treasury Secretary James Baker would be
directed to consider setting up a public debt authority to
purchase developing country debt at a discount. The debt would
be repackaged for sale to a secondary market.
    The debt plan was offered by International Development
Institutions subcommittee chairman Walter Fauntroy, a
non-voting Democratic delegate from the District of Columbia.
    The negotiations would aim for renegotiation of third world
debt with the new U.S. Public Debt Management Authority. The
new U.S. institution would act as manager for the loans and
oversee economic policies of the developing countries.
    One of its main purposes is the reduction in the debt
service burden of developing countries, Fauntroy said.

    Manufacturers Hanover said it raised common shareholders'
equity at the end of the third quarter from the second quarter
by 347 mln dlrs, to 2.09 billion dlrs. Included in the increase
was 267 mln dlrs from the sale last month of 6.9 mln new shares
of the corporation's common stock, and 76 mln dlrs from
retained earnings.
   
    Primary capital grew to 6.2 billion dlrs, or 7.92 pct of
total assets, up from 5.3 billion dlrs, or 7.07 pct, a year
earlier.
    Provisions for possible loans losses in the third quarter
was 111.9 mln dlrs, down from 139.5 mln a year ago. The reserve
for loan losses stood at 4.78 pct of total loans at the end of
September, up from 1.72 pct a year earlier.
    ""We have placed top priority on the restoration of
shareholders' equity in the shortest time frame possible,"" said
John McGillicuddy, chairman and chief executive.
    ""The first step was selling the full amount of new common
equity we anticipate needing in this replenishment process,""
McGillicuddy added. ""The remainder will come from higher core
earnings, the sale of undervalued, non-strategic assets and the
recognition of tax benefits.""
    Taken together, he said, these moves, as well as tighter
control over asset levels, will raise the corporation's common
equity-to-assets ratio to the four-pct range by the end of
1988. The ratio was 2.77 pct on September 30.
    For the nine months, Manufacturers reported a net loss of
1.16 billion dlrs, down from a gain of 301.8 mln a year ago.
    On a per-share basis, the loss was 28.33 dlrs, down from a
gain of 6.42 dlrs.
    The nine-month results reflect the impact of a previously
announced decision last quarter to boost the corporation's
loan-loss reserves by 1.7 billion dlrs. Without the addition,
net income would have been 263.3 mln dlrs, or 5.41 a share.

10244,ANGOLAN REBELS OFFER TO REOPEN BENGUELA RAILROAD,"Angola's U.S.-backed UNITA rebel
group has offered to reopen the Benguela railroad that runs
through UNITA-held territory and links landlocked Zaire and
Zambia to the Angolan port of Lobito.
    UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, in a statement made in his
Jamba headquarters in southern Angola and released by UNITA's 
Washington office, said he was prepared to guarantee safe
passage for non-military freight as a gesture of ""peace and
reconciliation.""
    Savimbi challenged the Cuban-backed Angolan government,
which controls the port, to match his offer and allow goods to
pass through. There was no immediate response from Luanda.
    UNITA has been fighting the Cuban-backed Angolan government
since 1976.
    The offer of a rail route to the Atlantic would help South
Africa's black neighbors reduce their economic dependence on
South Africa.
    The U.S. Congress is currently considering a proposal to
spend some 500 mln dlrs to build another railroad to help these
states become less dependent on South Africa.
    The Beira corridor runs through Mozambique to Tanzania's
Indian ocean ports but Savimbi suggested the Benguela route as
an alternative.
    ""The Benguela route can safely open immediately,"" he said. ""It
will provide the transportation our neighbors need, and it will
not cost the Americans the money they say it will cost to open
the Beira corridor.""

    He also said he had not heard anything about Deputy Premier
Shin Kanemaru suggesting modification of the tax.
    The Japanese press has reported that Kanemaru proposed
yesterday a freeze or a modification of the value-added tax as
he saw growing public opposition.
    Debate on the sales tax has been stalled by a sporadic
opposition boycott over their objections to the tax.

budget for fiscal 1987 beginning on April 1.
    The minister declined to comment on wide-spread press
speculation that the stop-gap budget would total more than
1,000 billion yen.
    The Government is working on a provisional budget as the
chances of passing a full one by April 1 are virtually nil as a
result of the halt in parliamentary business, officials said.
    The Government wants to include as many economic stimuli as
possible in the provisional budget to boost domestic demand,

statement.
    The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card user
fee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for each

    A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the

move, but he would not elaborate.
    Canada's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had

unpaid balances, if the financial institutions did not
voluntarily act.
    The Canadian Imperial Bank spokesman said ""the bank card
market is a very competitive one and we have to move to stay

billion, the Banking Information Service said.
    The unadjusted rise was 2.77 billion stg, up from 844 mln
in April.
    The May surge in borrowing from the clearing banks was
prompted by the fall in base rates, which reached nine pct on
May 11, the Banking Information Service said. Borrowing through
bill finance and other sources shrank.
    The increase in lending in May was seen in most categories,
the Banking Information Service said.
    In the personal sector, on an unadjusted basis, mortgage
lending rose 544 mln stg compared with 471 mln in April.
General consumption went up 399 mln against 355 mln, though
credit card debt rose only 55 mln compared with 161 mln.
    Financial sector borrowing was up 734 mln stg in May

8203,BAKER EXPECTED TO DEFEND DEBT STRATEGY,"Treasury Secretary James Baker, facing
the toughest challenge to his Third World debt plan so far, is
expected today to stoutly defend the strategy.
     At an opening address to the annual meeting of the
Inter-American Development Bank here Baker is likely once again
to bluntly reject alternative approaches like wholesale debt
relief.
     The speech comes after Washington delayed its bid to wrest
control of IADB lending from Latin nations.
     The Treasury Secretary is also expected, U.S. officials
say, to portray that attempt as a crucial element in his plan
to promote inflation-free economic growth, open markets, and a
much-reduced government role in the economies of Latin America.
     ""We have already seen substantial progress,"" Baker said in
a Miami Herald article and argued the plan was never meant to
be a ""quick fix"".
     But Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Nicaragua and Bolivia have all
ceased servicing some or all of their debt. Brazil's interest
payments moratorium, announced last month, is being seen as a
major challenge to the Baker plan.
     Owing foreigners 109 billion dlrs, Brazil called an
indefinite interest payments moratorium on 68 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt.
     Brazilian Central Banker Francisco Gros met bankers last
night to begin what U.S. officials predict will be months of
extremely tough negotiations.
     The scale of the problem is immense. Owing some 382
billion dlrs of foreign debt, Latin nations have since the
start of the decade paid out some  200 billion dlrs in interest
and principal and received about 28 billion dlrs in new loans.
     In addition, upwards of 100 billion dlrs in capital flight
is estimated to have left the region during that time.
     The Baker plan, unveiled in October, 1985, calls on
commercial and multilateral banks to increase lending by about
29 billion dlrs in the three subsequent years to the 15 major
debtors engaging in fundamental economic reform.
     The theory runs that once a debtor nation has reformed its
economy, it can service its debt comfortably and without an
atmosphere of crisis.
     U.S. officials emphasize some 8.5 billion dlrs has been
paid out in the first 14 months of the plan, payments of over
70 billion dlrs of debt has been stretched out into the future 
and Washington  is embracing new and innovative ideas to keep
debtor-creditor negotiations afloat.
     Baker is expected to underscore these points in his
address today.

20924,NYSE CHAIRMAN SAYS MARKET DECLINE NOT A CRASH,"New York Stock Exchange chairman John
Phelan said the stock market underwent a significant correction
today but he did not characterize it as a crash. He also said
the NYSE will open tomorrow on time.
    ""The market underwent a significant fall and a significant
devaluation of assets of which we are all concerned,"" he said.
    Speaking to reporters, Phelan listed several reasons why
the market fell today. He said stocks have been going up for
five years without a correction. He also blamed inflation
fears, rising interest rates, a lower dollar and problems with
Iran. ""All came together in a very nervous market"" he said.
    ""It's the nearest thing to a meltdown that I ever want to
see,"" Phelan said. Phelan said what he meant by meltdown was a
snowballing effect where selling fed on itself.
    Phelan said the NYSE is going through its standard
procedures before trading begins tomorrow. Those procedures
include checking with member firms on their liquidity, margin
positions, and backlog. ""We know of no firm that has a
significant problem, but that could change at any moment,"" he
said.
    Asked for advice for the average investor, Phelan said, ""We
do not know where the market will end up.""
    The Dow Jones Industrial average declined a record 508
points to 1738.74. Volume was a record setting 605 mln shares,
almost double the previous record.
    Phelan, in response to a question on declines in foreign
markets, said he believes there is no loss of confidence in the
global economy. He added that the underlying fundamentals of
the U.S. economy are still strong, and that corporate earnings
also continue to be firm.
    Phelan explained today's record descent as being the result
of a confluence of factors, including the globalization of
markets and the proliferation of new securities instruments.
    Those two factors alone have made the market more volatile,
he said.
    Phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the fact
that there has been no major correction in the five-year bull
market. He also pointed to rising tension in the Mideast Gulf.
    The New York Stock Exchange was in constant contact with
the Securities and Exchange Commission about a possible halt in
all trading on the exchange, Phelan said. ""The consensus was
that it is better to let the market try to work itself out,"" he
said.
    In addition, Phelan said that with the global nature of
trading there is no guarantee that halting trading on the New
York Stock Exchange would have served any purpose. Phelan said
he was in contact with the Treasury department, White House and
the Federal Reserve, but that the contact was made as a matter
of routine.

fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage

Committee has unanimously called for a ""substantial"" cut in
credit card interest rates charged by banks and other financial

5169,TENSE TRADE TIES TO DOMINATE EC TALKS,"Tense trade relations with the U.S.
And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed
European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are
expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here
tomorrow.
    EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the
EC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on
domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a
proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations.
    The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform
package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this
month, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as
the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of
tensions with major trading partners.
    The proposal is described by its promoters as a
stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going
into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut
cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward
tax.
    They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats
production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by
a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two
billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm
costs.
    It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as
well as foreign exporters, led by the United States.
    The diplomats said the protests had been received from most
corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from
Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada,
Iceland and Norway.
    The proposal had little chance of approval by EC
governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as
Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also
unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom.
    Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and
Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not
seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to
the list of products affected.
    But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S.
And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote
anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should
demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within
the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument.
    The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the
U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a
bill that would curb EC textile exports.
    The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly
back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if
enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation.

6238,FINANCIAL TIMES LAUNCHES NEW WORLD SHARE INDEX,"The Financial Times newspaper said it
has launched a new international share index, which represents
more than 70 pct of the world's total stock market value. The
FT-Actuaries World Indices, published for the first time today,
feature a main world share index and indices plotting the
movement of share prices in different regions and individual
countries, the FT said.
    The first world share indices will be published on an
up-to-date daily basis. The indices are based on the prices of
around 2,400 equity securities from 23 countries.
    Calculated on the same basis as the FT-Actuaries Indices
for UK securities, the indices will be produced daily and
published in the Financial Times. The daily tables have a
series of regional indices together with the overall world
index.
    The FT said its main aim was to provide a set of
measurements against which the performance of international
fund managers could be judged. Markets, companies and
securities have been included only when direct holdings of
shares by foreign nationals are allowed, it said. The FT said
to keep the whole series manageable it has kept the number of
companies from the U.S. To 600.
    The indices are calculated in three seperate currencies -
the US dollar, sterling and the appropriate local currency.
    The regional indices are calculated in a way that takes
into account the relative weight of local capitalisations.The
gross dividend yield is also published on the basis of what
foreign shareholders are entitled to receive before withholding
taxes.
    The FT said it has decided to calculate these numbers after
the enourmous growth in the volume of cross-border equity
investment in recent years.

10640,COFFEE PRICES BAD NEWS FOR LATIN AMERICA -MINISTER,"A senior Nicaraguan official said a
recent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically
disastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries.
    Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca
was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)
executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend
in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to
discuss the fall in coffee prices.
    London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to
1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.
    Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed
to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on
Latin America, both economically and politically.
    He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to
pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.
    Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under
an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago
when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.
    Central American economic ministers have estimated the
region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in
1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,
Martinez said.
    He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because
consumer members lack the political will to fully support
commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to
producers.

19392,BRAZIL'S MOTOR INDUSTRY SUFFERS MAJOR SLOWDOWN,"Brazil's crisis-ridden motor industry
-- which is dominated by the subsidiaries of Volkswagen AG
&lt;VOWG.F>, Fiat Spa &lt;FIAT.MI>, General Motor Corp &lt;GM> and Ford
Co &lt;F> -- has not made a single domestic sale for the last four
days, and several assembly lines will stop shortly, industry
spokesmen said.
    The motor manufacturers have been feeling the pinch for
months, with demand slumping as the country heads into
recession.
    But the industry hit a fresh problem when dealers decided
on Tuesday to stop buying any cars or trucks to protest high
government taxes on vehicles. The dealers' decision was sparked
by a 33 pct increase in car prices authorized last week by the
government to cover industry's rising costs.
    Spokesman Marcio Stefani of the Brazilian Association of
Autmotive Vehicle Distributors said dealers felt their
livelihood was at stake -- cars aren't selling because they
cost too much.
    ""It is a question of our survival. The price of cars in
Brazil has reached an insupportable level,"" he said. A GM Opala
Diplomata, he said, costs 30,000 dlrs in Brazil, while an
equivalent car in the United States would cost about 10,000
dlrs.
    The National Association of Automotive Vehicle
Manufacturers said that if the trade's boycott continues for
another week, consequences will be serious.
    Association spokesman Fred Carvalho told Reuters, ""The
consequences will first of all be collective holidays then
lay-offs and a more and more catastrophic situation.""
    A spokesman for Ford Brasil said it would tell about half
of its 21,000 workforce to take holidays June 29-July 13.
    Fiat announced yesterday that it would give 2,000 workers a
month's holiday, from July 6, halting production for the
domestic market.
    Carvalho said the industry was working at 3,500 vehicles a
day, below its 1986 average of 4,700 and capacity of 5,100.
    During last year's Cruzado Plan price freeze, feverish
demand far outstripped supply. The industry says it could have
sold many more cars than it produced, but was constrained by a
lack of parts.
    Today the picture is completely different after months of
raging inflation and demand has all but disappeared.
    Carvalho said the government taxes on cars added 138 pct to
the cost of the vehicle. He described the taxes as ""the highest
in the universe and the galaxy.""
    Domestic car sales during the first five months of this
year slipped to their lowest level for a decade, 241,632 units
compared with 382,182 units during the same period last year.
    On the bright side, exports are booming -- sales abroad in
May totalled 242 mln dlrs, a record figure.
    The motor industry is critical of the government of
President Jose Sarney, which has gained a reputation as an
indifferent manager of the economy.
    Last month Volkswagen said it was postponing indefinitely
investments of 150 mln dlrs planned for this year.
    Wolfgang Sauer, president of Volkswagen do Brasil, said the
government had created a crisis of confidence.
    Brazil's motor industry employs more than 150,000 people.

18507,JAPAN FINISHING UP WORK ON SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET,"The Finance Ministry is putting the
finishing touches on a roughly 2,000 billion yen supplementary
budget for 1987/88 and has started to turn its attention to
next year's main budget, ministry officials said.
    The supplementary budget is designed to help finance the
6,000 billion yen emergency economic package the government
unveiled last month to boost domestic demand.
    Ministry officials said the government would issue about
1,300 billion yen in construction bonds to help pay for the
increased public investment set out in the emergency package.
    The rest of the supplementary budget will be financed by
450 billion yen in proceeds from last year's sale of shares in
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) and by higher than
expected 1986/87 tax revenues, officials said.
    One official said the carry-over of tax revenues into the
1987/88 fiscal year that began on April 1 might be more than
1,000 billion yen. Soaring land and share prices have boosted
receipts, especially from securities and land taxes.
    With less than half of the carry-over likely to be used in
the current supplementary budget, the rest will be available
for a second supplementary budget expected later this year.
    The second supplementary budget will be used to finance the
government's wage bill, which will not be known until after
wage talks later this year, one official said.
    The government must also finance the tax cut of more than
1,000 billion yen which it promised in its emergency package
but which will not be contained in the first supplementary
budget, due to be presented to parliament next month.
    The Finance Ministry's budget bureau is hoping the tax
carry-over and higher than expected revenues again this year
will be enough to finance the second supplementary budget, he
said.
    Officials said the Finance Ministry does not want to issue
deficit-financing bonds or use the extra proceeds from this
year's NTT share sale to fund the second supplementary budget.
    Besides the first supplementary budget, the government also
intends to introduce a new tax reform bill to parliament during
the upcoming extraordinary session, officials said.
    The government was forced to abandon its first tax reform
bill due to strong opposition to its plan to introduce a five
pct sales tax.
    The sales tax was designed to help finance cuts in
individual and corporate income taxes.
    The new bill will present the 1,000 billion yen-plus tax
cut contained in the emergency package as the first step to an
overhaul of the country's tax system, officials said.
    It will also contain a controversial plan to phase out tax
breaks on savings, although it may not take effect in October
as originally planned, they said.
    Looking ahead to next year's main budget, the Finance
Ministry is beginning to debate whether to abandon its
so-called minus ceiling for public investment.
    That policy calls on government departments to cut public
investment spending by five pct per year.
    Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo said recently the
policy would be suspended in 1988/89, pending a recommendation
from the government's administrative reform council.
    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said in April that
budget request guidelines for invesment expenditures would be
reviewed.
    But some officials at the Finance Ministry's budget bureau
said they were hopeful the policy would be retained.
    They fear that a suspension of the guidelines for public
investment could lead to increased pressure on the government
to loosen its grip on current expenditures as well.
    The account would also extend interest-free loans to
profitable public works projects developed in conjunction with
the private sector, the officials said.
    In this way, the Finance Ministry could meet growing
pressure on it to boost capital spending while maintaining a
tight grip on outlays by other government departments.
    Surplus funds from this year's sale of NTT shares could
total about 3,000 billion yen. Based on the current market
price, the planned sale of 1.95 mln shares would raise more
than 5,000 billion yen, compared to about 2,000 billion planned
for in the main 1987/88 budget.

flexible' attitude from its creditor banks in current talks to
reschedule 21 billion dlrs in foreign debt, finance minister
manuel azpurua told a press conference.
    He declined to comment on meetings this week in new york
between public finances director jorge marcano and venezuela's
13-bank advisory committee except to say, ""they are
progressing.""
    Azpurua said venezuela has shown solidarity with brazil's
decision to suspend payments, but each country must negotiate
according to its own interest.
    Asked to comment on chile's agreement with its creditors
today, which includes an interest rate margin of one pct over
libor, azpurua said only, ""that is good news.""
    According to banking sources, the banks' latest offer to
venezuela is also a one pct margin as against the last
february's 1-1/8 pct rescheduling accord and the 7/8 pct
Venezuela wants.
    Azpurua said four basic elements are being negotiated with
the banks now: spread reduction, deferral of principal payments
due in 1987 and 1988, lenghtening the 12-1/2 year repayment
schedule, and debt capitalization schemes.
    Azpurua said the governent plans to pay 2.1 billion dlrs in
public and private debt principal this year. It was due to
amortize 1.05 billion dlrs under the rescheduling, and pay 420
mln dlrs in non-restructured principal, both public sector.
    He said venezuela's original proposal was to pay no
principal on restructured debt this year, but is now insisting
that if it makes payments they be compensated by new bank
loans.
    The banking sources said the committee has been prepared to
lower amortizations to around 400 mln dlrs this year, but that
no direct commitment was likely on new loans.
    ""debtors and bank creditors have a joint responsibility and
there will be no lasting solution unless a positive flow of
financing is guaranteed,"" azpurua said.
    However, he appeared to discard earlier venezuelan
proposals for a direct link between oil income and debt
payments, ""because circumstances change too quickly.""
    At the same time, he said the government is presently
studying possible mechanisms for capitlizing public and private
sector foreign debt, based on experience in other countries.
The rules would be published by the finance ministry and the
central bank.

investor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibits
Edelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtain
control of the company and that limits the Edelman group's
ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting
securities.
    The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending
litigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said.
    The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's
motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against
Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said.
    In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to
Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the
company said.
    Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the
company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for
December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views
concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting
power of substantial Lucky stockholders.
    Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock,
last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.
    Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring
program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own
common shares and reincorporation in Delaware.
    The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retail
stores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program.
    Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership

reincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase and

19107,LAWSON SAYS LOW U.K. UNIT WAGE COSTS HELP EXPORTS,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
said current low unit wage costs are helping British exports
but wage rises are ""faster than is comfortable.""
    He hoped yesterday's Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) forecasts of increases in wage rises
were wrong, saying OECD predictions ""are somewhat unreliable.""
    ""Productivity is rising very fast, and therefore even though
wages are going up faster than is comfortable, the actual unit
cost of labour...Is not going up fast at all,"" Lawson said in
answer to questions on BBC radio.
    ""That is one of the reasons why we're doing so well in
export markets, for example, but we could do even better and
get unemployment down even faster if there was a more moderate
rate of growth in wage increases,"" Lawson added.
    His remarks followed yesterday's news that underlying
average earnings were rising 7.75 pct annually in April, up
from March's 7.5 pct increase, which sent the U.K. Government
bond market lower and helped trigger inflation worries.
    Lawson said he would not update his own economic forecasts
for the U.K. Until the traditional Autumn Statement on the
economy.
    Lawson would not be drawn on whether he will cut the basic
rate of tax from the current 27 pct to 25 pct in the next
budget due in March 1988.
    ""We will certainly achieve it sooner or later,"" he said.
    The latest official data, released yesterday, showed unit
wage costs in manufacturing industry were rising 0.9 pct
annually in the three month period ended April, down from a 1.2
pct rise in the first quarter and sharply below last year's
first quarter growth rate of 7.8 pct.
    However, analysts said this figure is likely to deteriorate
somewhat as productivity growth slows later this year.

In the year earlier period it earned 64.9 mln dlrs. Sales rose

302,WALLENBERGS FIGHT BID FOR SWEDISH MATCH STAKE,"Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back
a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to
secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the
companies at the core of their business empire.
    A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB
Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken
over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33
pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.
    Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which
Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.
    Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at
424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting
rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
the free shares.
    The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to
49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.
    The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously
amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
    The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400
mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
    The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms
and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo
&lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco
&lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>.
    Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and
Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.
    Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also
managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg
company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>.
    During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on
building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent
any raid on the heart of their business empire.
    But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the
electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small
at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe
interests to protect its core activities.

17207,ADB DELEGATES GATHER IN JAPAN AMID CONTROVERSY,"Delegates from 46 countries are
gathering for the 20th meeting of the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) amid concern over the bank""s role in aiding regional
development.
    The three-day meeting, the first to be held in Japan since
the bank""s inaugural meeting in Tokyo in 1966, will open
tomorrow with political controversy dogging its heels.
    Taiwan, one of the ADB""s founders, will boycott the meeting
for the second year in succession in protest against China""s
admission last year.
    Taiwan, which borrowed only 100 mln dlrs or 0.51 pct of the
ADB""s total lending of 19.4 billion dlrs over the past 20 years,
is staying away because its name was changed by the bank to
""Taipei, China.""
    But the boycott is likely to be overshadowed by the
presence of communist giants China and the Soviet Union.
    Moscow is attending an ADB meeting for the first time in
what is widely seen as a first step to eventual full
membership.
    China is expected to obtain its first loans from the bank
in 1987.
    A senior ADB official said Peking, now the bank""s third
largest shareholder after the United States and Japan, would
also take one of the 12 seats on the bank""s board of governors.
    The official, who declined to be identified, expected
sparks to fly when governors met in formal session on Tuesday.
    He said calls for expanded bank lending were expected from
poorer countries in the Asia-Pacific region, hit by plunging
commodity prices, tariff barriers in export markets, a growing
resources crunch and balance of payments crises.
    But the U.S. Delegation was likely to repeat warnings ADB
lending should stress quality over quantity, the official said.
    The debate over ADB lending is fuelled by the bank""s highly
successful money management.
    With liquid reserves of about four billion dlrs, profits
have been rising steadily and touched 287 mln dlrs last year.
    The key indicator of the ADB""s reduced role in regional
development is its net transfer of resources -- loan
disbursements less repayments made by borrowers -- which fell
sharply to 237 mln dlrs in 1986 from 421 mln in 1985.
    In 1986, the bank approved loans totalling two billion
dlrs, but only to 19 of its 29 developing members.
    ADB chief economist Kedar Nath Kohli told Reuters the bank""s
ordinary lending had declined each year since 1984.
    ""I""m afraid if you exclude India and China, it""s going to go
down even further in 1987,"" Kohli said.
    Kohli said developing countries in the region were entering
a period of painful adjustments.
    He said one country that seemed to be on the right track
was South Korea, which had bucked the regional trend of rising
indebtedness by cutting its foreign debt by about two billion
dlrs last year.
    One country that has complained about the ADB's lending
policies is Vietnam, which charged at last year's meeting that
the bank had cut off its aid on political grounds.
    The bank abruptly halted loans to Hanoi after the fall of
the Saigon government in 1975. Despite Moscow's presence,
however, the bank is not expected to change its Vietnam policy.
    The Philippines, the ABD's second-largest borrower in 1986
with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs, is happy with the bank's
role.
    Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters he expected the
figure would reach roughly the same level this year.

8815,U.S. COURT ALLOWS OFFSHORE ALASKAN EXPLORATION,"A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that
oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the
Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to
eight major oil companies.
    The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies
and the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing
program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that
challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.
    The administration said that the court-ordered halt in
drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid
for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.
    A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt
all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in
the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the
subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.
    But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in
issuing an injunction halting exploration.
    ""Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was
not at all probable,"" Justice Byron White wrote for the court.
""And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact
that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs
to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which
they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration
been enjoined,"" he said.
    The oil companies, Amoco Corp &lt;AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp &lt;XON>,
Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Union Oil,
had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in
staggering financial losses.
    The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and
generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984
covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.
    Administration officials, saying the lease sales were
preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that
the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.
    The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an
organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that
the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.

11368,MOODY'S LAUNCHES U.S. CORPORATE BOND INDEX,"Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
launched today a new index of investment grade U.S. corporate
bonds based on 100 issues.
    The rating agency noted that Commodity Exchange Inc, Comex,
filed with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in October
1986 a proposal to list a futures contract based on the index.
Trading is expected to start later this year.
    Moody's said it calculated end-of-month index values back
to December 1979. Corporate bond prices closed on Friday at
274.01, up from the index's initial value of 100.00 on December
31, 1979, the agency said.
    The Moody's index includes a sample of liquid bonds Moody's
chose to mirror the credit quality, maturity, duration and
coupon distribution of bonds in the industrial, utility and
financial sectors of the U.S. secondary market.
    However, it excludes convertible subordinated debenture
issues and tax-exempt bonds, as well as bonds with maturities
under five years or with variable-rate coupons.
    The rating agency said the index has been designed to
reflect changes in corporate bond prices as they occur
throughout the trading day.

14390,U.S. CREDIT MARKETS MIXED AT MIDSESSION,"U.S. credit markets were mixed in dull
trading at midsession, with moderate losses in coupon issues
and Treasury bill rates near unchanged.
    Bills improved slightly on remarks from Federal Reserve
chairman Paul Volcker that a restrictive monetary policy would
be damaging to investment and that last week's increases in
U.S. banks' prime lending rates to 7.75 pct from 7.50 pct was
not connected with Fed policy, dealers said.
     Coupon issues were 1/32 to 5/16 lower, pressured by a weak
dollar. Treasury bill rates were anywhere from three basis
points lower to one basis point higher.
    The key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond was 5/16 lower at 95-26/32
to yield 7.87 pct compared with 7.84 pct at yesterday's close.
    Dealers said remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker indicating that exchange rates had adjusted enough to
narrow the U.S. trade deficit and warning that a further,
sizable dollar fall could be counterproductive had little
exchange rate impact as they were seen as a reiteration of his
views.
    In any case, they said the dollar is expected to be under
pressure while monetary officials of leading industrial nations
meet this week in Washington, which may hurt bonds.
    Dealers said three-month bill rates had eased early in the
session on a few sizable buy orders from retail accounts, but
that otherwise there was little activity in this sector.
    ""When Volcker hit the tape it helped bills, because it
makes people think the Fed is not going to tighten,"" a bill
trader said. ""But it's a nervous trade, with no real buyers.""
    Three-month bills were bid at 5.50 pct, three basis points
below their price at yesterday's auction, while six-month bills
rose one basis point from their auction price to 5.64 pct bid.
    Year bills rose one basis points to 5.74 pct bid.
    Most economists expected the Federal Reserve to supply
temporary reserves, but most had forecasted an indirect
injection via customer repurchase agreements rather than a
direct injection via two-day system repurchases which the Fed
conducted at its usual intervention time.
    The Fed intervened when Federal funds were trading at 6-1/8
pct. Funds opened at this level and remained there at midday,
down from yesterday's 6.20 pct avearge.
    The 6-3/8 pct two-year notes fell 1/32 to 99-21/32 at
midday and the 7-1/4 pct 10-years dropped 9/32 to 97-27/32.

    The department said the USSR dominated the week's activity
with purchases of 1.4 mln tonnes (which were earlier reported
under the daily reporting system). Other large increaes were
posted for Japan and unknown destinations, it said.
    Taiwan purchased 296,300 tonnes for the 1986/87 season and
170,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, it said.
    Wheat sales of 317,200 tonnes for the current season and
125,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were down about one-third
from the preceding week and the four-week average.
    Wheat sales to China of 60,000 tonnes were switched from
1986/87 to the 1987/88 season, it noted.
    Soybean sales of 483,100 tonnes were 11 pct above the prior
week and two-thirds above the four-week average.
    Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico and Portugal were the main
buyers, the department said.
    Soybean cake and meal sales of 289,400 tonnes were
two-thirds above the previous week and the largest of the
marketing year, with Venezuela the dominant purchaser.
    Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of
4,400 tonnes, as reductions for unknown destinations more than
offset increases for Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama,
the department said.
    Cotton sales of 57,900 running bales -- 43,800 bales for
the current year and 14,200 bales for the 1987/88 season --
were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the
four-week average.
    Turkey, Thailand, South Korea and Canada were the major

Japan were the major purchasers from the upcoming season, the
department said.
     Sorghum sales of 178,800 tonnes were two-thirds above the
prior week and 75 pct over the four-week average.
    Venezuela was the leading buyer it said.

894,JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS,"The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip
exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a
U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese
chipmakers doubt its usefulness.
    A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to
issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are
authorised exporters.
    Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be
required to show such a certificate, but those without it will
not automatically be denied licences, he said.
    But some industry officials predicted any government
measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the
world semiconductor market remained weak.
    U.S. Government and industry officials have complained
repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below
cost to third countries despite the July agreement.
    Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of
cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by
third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between
low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs
and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.
    The MITI spokesman said, ""If the percentage of grey market
is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are
distributing their products through their sales network knowing
they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask
them what they are doing to reduce the figure.""
    MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by
10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.
    But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. ""As long
as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market
prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to
make money,"" a Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T> spokesman said.

12118,WEATHERFORD INT'L &lt;WII> GETS DEBT AGREEMENT,"Weatherford International Inc said it

held by bank and insurance company lenders.
    Under the agreement, the oil drilling equipment and oil
services company will pay reduced quarterly interest payments
on part of its bank revolving credit loans and industrial
revenue bonds. Remaining interest will be deferred until Jan 1,
1991.
    Principal payments will be deferred, with semi-annual
payments of 1.75 mln dlrs to start on Dec 31, 1989 and all
remaining principal due Jan 1, 1991.
    Additional interest and principal payments may be due on
the bank revolving credit lines if the company generates more
cash than it needs for operations.
    Term of the debt held by insurance company lenders will be
extended by one year until December 1990 by reducing the
principal due last year and this year. Otherwise, interest and
principal payments will continue to be made as scheduled in the
existing agreements.
    The proposed restructuring will reduce Weatherford's cash
requirements by about three mln dlrs in 1987 and 2.5 mln dlrs
in 1988, it said.
    The company, which is still in default, said it expects to
completed amended loan agreements during the next few months.
    The company also said the recently announced sale of a
non-core production equipment unit and a Mexican subsidiary
will not have a material impact on future revenues and will
eliminate exposure to future losses.

17173,U.S. GASOLINE SURPLUS SEEN OVER NEAR TERM,"Unless U.S. refiners reduce the amount
of gasoline they now produce, the oil industry will enter the
coming summer driving season with the largest surplus of motor
fuel since 1984, oil analysts and traders said.
    ""They key question is how much gasoline refiners produce in
the coming weeks,"" said Larry Goldstein of Petroleum Industry
Research Inc. ""If refiners cut output and demand turns upward,
gasoline stocks could begin to draw, and the surplus could
potentially turn around in four to eight weeks,"" said
Goldstein.
    The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. gasoline stocks
for the week ended April 17 are 37.6 mln barrels above last
year's levels, and analysts said they don't believe the
expected one to two pct rise in demand will take care of the
surplus before the start of the summer driving season, which
begins Memorial Day weekend.
    The API said the last time stocks were this high was in
1984, when there was a 27 mln barrel excess. Oil traders said
that the surplus held throughout the summer of 1984, depressing
prices for the motor fuel.
    Over the past several weeks, analysts said they expected
refiners to reduce production because there was no profit in
continued production of gasoline due to the surplus. However,
refineries continued to operate at higher levels, they said.
    U.S. refineries have been running at about 78.8 pct of
capacity during March and April this year, compared to 77.5 at
this time last year, API statistics show.
    Because of the current excess in stocks, one planner for a
major oil company said he believed that most companies are
contemplating cutting refinery throughput over the near term.
    He said some refiners appear to be selling less
aggressively in order to have product on hand to meet the
expected rise in demand this summer.
    Goldstein said that other factors, such as higher speed
limits, the gasoline lead phasedown, and possible new
restrictions on gasoline vapor pressure could tighten the
supply situation this summer.
    However, a planner at another major oil company said that
although large inventories are dampening the price outlook for
gasoline this season, he does not expect refiners to cut output
soon.
    That oil company planner said high crude oil runs reduce
the refiner's average costs, making the incremental barrel of
gasoline cheaper to produce.
    Most analysts expect a slight upturn this summer over the
summer of 1986. Bo Poates, an analyst at the Energy Futures
Group Inc said he foresees demand up about one pct in the
second and third quarters of 1987.
    Chase Econometrics' Scott Jones sees gasoline demand rising
1.9 to 2.2 pct for the year, due mainly to continued low
prices.

17620,DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY,"A cut of about half a percentage point
in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although
economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.
    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,
encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide
premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,
might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.
    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances
rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its
repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.
    That rate has remained in force, just holding above the
five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial
bank borrowings.
    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German
repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,
forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.
    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to
three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money
market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans
rate on lending under its three month credit quota.
    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance
Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.
    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he
would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance
Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion
guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct
for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.
    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference
between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under
the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add
extra liquidity to the money market.
    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to
further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would
result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,
provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.
    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its
parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673
guilders per 100 marks.
    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10
guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level
that would not permit a change in the interest rate
differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers
said.
    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and
Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he
said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation
expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates
in the longer term.
    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,
or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts
point to a falling rate of economic growth.
    ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement
negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""
the ABN economist said.
    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in
January, could also contribute to some inflation.
    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to
two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,
currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the
second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.
    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying
spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,
probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below
five pct.
    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in
the money market.

2390,U.S. TO SET ORANGE JUICE DUTIES MONDAY,"The Commerce Department on Monday

in an interview.
    ""We are looking at more options to acquire more reserves
rather than just exploration,"" Conger said adding, ""the move to
consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's
acquisitions policy.""
    Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120
mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,
Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which
have not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an
acquisition, he said.
    Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be
about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said
exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than
last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas
exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6
pct.
    Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about
the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.
    However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin
reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400
ounces due to start-up production problems.
    He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400

5985,U.K. BUDGET SEES 1987 GDP GROWTH AT THREE PCT,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to Parliament,
said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar
1987.
    He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of
payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1
billion shortfall in 1986.
    Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of this
year, Lawson said.
    ""As I forecast in the Autumn Statement, inflation may
continue to edge up for a time, perhaps exceeding 4.5 pct by
the summer, before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the
year,"" he added.
    Turning to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR),
Lawson said the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87 was 4.0
billion stg, or 1.0 pct of GDP.
    The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was set at 4.0 billion stg.
    On monetary policy, Lawson confirmed the target range for
the narrow M0 measure would be two to six pct in fiscal
1987/88.
    No explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3
aggregate, he said. ""But broad money will continue to be taken
into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course
will the exchange rate,"" the Chancellor told Parliament.
    Lawson said the low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 ""is
chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of non-oil tax
revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an
increasingly profitable business sector in particular.""
    On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier
assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per
barrel in calendar 1987.
    He said ""it is clear that the increased flow of non-oil tax
revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the
economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the
public finances in a very strong position.""
    Lawson said the Treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at
1.0 pct of GDP in future.
    ""We have reached what I judge to be the (Medium Term
Financial Strategy's) appropriate destination - a PSBR of 1.0
pct of GDP. My aim will be to keep it there over the years
ahead,"" Lawson said.
    ""Inevitably, this greatly diminishes the scope I have this
year for reducing the burden of taxation, which of course
remains a major objective of government policy.""
    ""But I am sure it is right to err on the side of prudence
and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future.""
    Lawson said the time had come to strike the Exchange
Control Act from the Statute book.
    On corporation tax, he said the rate will remain unchanged
at 35 pct in 1987/88. But companies' capital gains will be
charged at the ""appropriate corporation tax rate.""
    He said that under the new proposed system, companies
should be able to set Advanced Capital Tax (ACT) payments
against tax on capital gains.
    ""Taken together, these changes should yield 60 mln stg in
1988/89,"" Lawson said.
    Lawson said he will propose that all companies and building
societies be treated the same way on payment of corporation
tax, ""with all liable to pay corporation tax nine months after
the end of the accounting period on which the tax is due.""
    ""I also propose to legislate now to pave the way for a new
method of collecting corporation tax, to be known as Pay and
File.""
    This would be part of a wider programme of streamlining tax
collection, and would not come into force until the early
1990s.
    Lawson said he planned two reliefs on Petroleum Revenue Tax
(PRT). As from today, companies may elect to have up to 10 pct
of the costs of developing certain new fields set against their
(PRT) liabilities in existing fields, until the income of those
new fields exceeds the costs incurred.
    Second, there will be a new relief against PRT for spending
on research into U.K. Oil extraction that is not related to any
particular field.
    On business employment, Lawson said employers will receive
tax relief for retraining workers.
    Lawson said that in future, traders registered for Value
Added Tax (VAT) would be able to choose to account for the tax
on the basis of cash paid and received.
    Small businesses may account for VAT annually instead of
quarterly. The VAT compulsory registration period was being
extended to 30 days, he added, and VAT registration thresholds
are to be raised to 21,300 stg.
    New measures are planned to combat VAT avoidance, he added.
    The capital gains tax retirement relief limit would now be
set at 125,000 stg.
    Lawson said he proposed to change the law so that companies
in multinational groups with dual residence will no longer be
able to secure tax relief twice on the same interest payment.
The change will take effect on April 1, 1987, but ""genuine
trading companies"" will not be affected.
    He also planned to end the present treatment of tax credit
relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank
loans, also from April 1.
    ""In future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit
only against tax on the profit on the relevant loan,"" he said.
    The standard rate of taxation is being reduced by two
pence, to 27 pct from 29 pct.
    Lawson reiterated the government's aim of reducing basic
taxation to 25 pence in the pound, but added ""given my decision
to use the greater part of the fiscal scope I now have to
reduce the PSBR, that goal cannot be achieved in this budget.""
    Small companies' corporation tax is also being reduced to
27 pct, he said.
    On the Lloyd's insurance market, Lawson said he planned to
change the tax treatment of Lloyd's syndicates, bringing it
into line with that of provisions for outstanding liabilities
made by ordinary insurance companies and of comparable
provisions made by financial traders.
    The Inland Revenue would be told to consult urgently with
Lloyd's about the details of the legislation, he said.
    ""The new rules will first apply to premiums payable for the
Lloyd's account which closes on December 31 this year,"" Lawson
said.

6940,GLOBAL FARM REFORM TOP U.S. PRIORITY - SHULTZ,"Dismantling agricultural subsidies
and implementing international farm policy reform will be the
top priorities of the United States at the upcoming Venice
Economic Summit, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group
of American farm leaders.
    ""We want to see the American farmer put in a position in
which he can compete on a level playing field,"" Shultz told the
board of directors for the National Association of Wheat
Growers.
    The global agricultural situation is in the midst of the
most serious farm crisis in modern history, Shultz said, and
how the U.S. responds to the current problems will determine
whether the U.S. will continue its leadership role in world
agriculture.
    Government policies that subsidize production and exports
have created a ""crisis of overproduction,"" he said. Shultz
particularly criticized European Community policies which he
said encourage domestic production by providing high government
supports to farmers and then exporting the surplus product with
the help of huge subsidies.
    The U.S. and its trading partners cannot afford to continue
current high levels of subsidies, he said. But the U.S. cannot
stop subsidies alone, Shultz said. ""We have to agree to
dismantle these systems together,"" he said.
    The U.S., EC and Japan have the obligation to take the lead
in agricultural reform, he said. For that reason, U.S.
officials will push for farm reform at the Venice meeting and
have made it a top priority for GATT negotiations in Geneva.

20614,U.S. SAFETY NETS SHOULD BLOCK 1929-TYPE CRASH,"Cascading global stock prices are
evoking grim memories of the great market crash of 1929, but
analysts are reminding investors of safeguards in place before
they stash their savings under the mattress.
    But some also say that while banking, securities and social
laws written during the great depression should prevent a
repeat of that dismal era, more protection still might have to
be considered.
   
    And analysts caution that while new laws can deal with some
problems, lawmakers can't legislate away fear--which  helped
drive the New York Stock Exchange to its record 508-point Dow
Jones index loss on Monday.
    That 22.6 percent loss nearly doubled the Oct 29, 1929 
loss of 11.7 percent. On the day before that year, the market
fell nearly 13 per cent.
    In a series of Reuters interviews with government,
congressional and private analysts, most agreed safeguards
exist to avoid a repeat of 1929 and its depression aftermath.
    Charles Schultze, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers under Jimmy Carter, said in an interview that
""the safeguards should be adequate to avoid a repeat of 1929 to
1933.""
    ""The safeguards are fine,"" he said, ""The safeguards are
adequate to prevent a cascading liquidity failure. That's not
the overall problem which is the dollar and trade deficits.""
    Schultze, now with the Brookings Institution think-tank,
pointed to a weak Federal Reserve during the 1920s when ""the Fed
acted in the wrong way in 1929--it tightened money.""
   
    Similarly, President Reagan's budget manager, James Miller,
told Reuters the safeguards in place should be adequate.
    And millionaire oilman and business takeover specialist T.
Boone Pickens said the present safeguards should avoid any 1929
situation.
    ""It is a much more sophisticated system, I don't see that a
comparison is valid.""
    Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute, thinks the present
safeguards will work.
   
    ""The main thing is the understanding of the Federal Reserve
of its responsibility to maintain liquidity in the economy,"" he
said. ""There is no reason why this (market fall) needs to spread
into the real economy. Maybe it's better it happened at all.""
    Rex Hardesty of the huge labor confederation AFL-CIO said
many of the present safeguards are not working, saying ""only
one-third of the unemployed are now receiving benefits.""
    He also called for an increase in the 3.35 dlr minimum wage
which has not been raised since 1981.
    One of the main things that appears different in 1987 than
in 1929 is market psychology, analysts point out.
    During those anything goes days of flappers and bathtub
gin, the stock market was the road to riches that captured the
savings of shoeshine boys to bank presidents. It was viewed as
a highway to heaven with no turning back.
    But happy days soon collapsed into a nationwide, hysterical
panic with the stock market crash, wiping out paper millions
and losing the life savings of many average investors as panic
set in.
    Brokers leaped from Wall Street skyscrapers. American banks
closed for a  ""holiday"" in 1933 as depositors clamored to pull
out their savings. The great depression followed leading into
World War II.
    Images of those days surfaced with the unprecedented sell
off on Monday, but analysts maintained times are different.
    House Banking committee specialist Jake Lewis said that
bank investors should have no fears because their savings are
now completely backed by the government. 
    Even though there have been record bank failures --145 last
year, 148 this year through today--everyone received their
savings--unlike the millions lost when banks collapsed 60 years
ago.
     Banking deposits, then uninsured, now are fully insured by
the government up to 100,000 dlrs for each saver.
    As the depression swept the nation, President Franklin
Roosevelt steered into law sweeping banking and securities
reforms to deal with many of the problems that led to the crash
and hurt people afterwards.

economic growth and inflation, the Shadow Open Market Committee
said in its semi-annual policy statement.
    The SOMC, a group of basically ""monetarist"" private
economists, said that ""economic growth will accelerate in 1987
in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal
Reserve.""
    The group said the Fed's actions have been excessive. As a
result, it said that ""inflation and ultimately another
recession now loom on the horizon.""
    The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on
progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead
to sustainable economic growth and stable prices.
    The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or
inflation growth in its policy statement. However, the
Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was
basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a
member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.
    Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage
point higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer
prices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.
    The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been
a principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly
inflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to ""abandon
its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary
base on the path toward sustained lower inflation.""

    The SEC's general counsel said, ""we currently anticipate

6541,ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY,"Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry
plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of
recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts
and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.
    The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored
rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the
market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea
through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.
    The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct
more competitive than Japan's due to such factors.
    The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of
current capacity within two years through mergers and
regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month
and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.
    They said from September a semi-government body will assure
repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred
through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another
30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.
    Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied
to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage
built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.
    The commission has held several hearings with the industry
and approval should be given this month, the sources said.
    A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a
planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support
should help Japanese yards recover their international
competitiveness, they said.
    Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of
building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a
maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)
in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.
    This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most
yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.
    The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for
1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to
3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.
    The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to
30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between
1986 and 1989.
    Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,
followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's
Register of Shipping.
    However, falling orders and declining international
competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in
the industry, the sources said.
    Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding
companies reported current deficits in the first half of the
year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report
current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.
    The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise
productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also
been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt
years, the sources said.
    In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in
fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The
two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T>
and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> --
account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.
    ""World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out
the recession as their technology is the best in the world,""
said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.
    The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's,
has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships,
and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.

13234,PERU SAYS IT INTENDS TO DEEPEN DEBT STANCE,"President Alan Garcia said he sought to
deepen Peru's hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly by
limiting repayments to the World Bank.
    In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World
Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount
the bank is willing to make in new loans. ""We will deepen our
policy on the foreign debt,"" he said.
    Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of
export earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due
foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally
been current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on
payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank.
    But tonight Garcia said: ""We have met our aim of limiting
the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though
organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us
to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types
of public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars
than that which they are willing to newly lend us.""
    The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank
about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr
debt.
    Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin
America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic
product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line
on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year.
    He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage
to 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage
workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln.
    Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants
and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but

1353,GM &lt;GM> TO REPUCHASE COMMON STOCK,"General Motors Corp said its directors
authorized the repurchase of up to 20 pct of its 1.66 dlr par
value common stock by the end of 1990.
    GM said the level of repurchases this year will not exceed
10 mln shares or about three pct of its outstanding stock.
    It said the stock repurchase, as market conditions permit,
will be funded from a portion of the cash flows generated by
reduced capital spending and anticipated performance
improvements.
    GM also said its board authorized the repurchase of as many
as five mln shares each of its class E and class H common, with
about half of the proposed repurchases completed by year end.
    GM also said it is considering offering an odd-lot
repurchase program for its class H stock by mid-year.
    GM said the class E and H repurchases would increase
participation in the net income of its Electronic Data Systems
Corp &lt;GME> and Hughes Electronic Corp &lt;GMH> subsidiaries by
holders of its 1.66 dlr par value common.
    GM also said it anticipates a decrease in automotive
capital spending, excluding EDS and Hughes Aircraft Co, to 7.9
billion dlrs in 1987 and 5.8 billion dlrs in 1989, from 10.6
billion dlrs in 1986.
    It also said improvements in operating performance are
expected to amount to 10 billion dlrs annually by 1990.
    ""We have one overriding objective--to position GM so that
it is producing the best products available in an increasingly
competitive global marketplace,"" said Chairman Roger B. Smith.
    GM had 319.4 mln shares of its 1.66 dlr par value common
outstanding, 53.5 mln shares of class E and 66.6 mln shares of
class H outstanding at year end 1986.
    GM said that its par value holders currently participate in
the 56 pct of the earnings of EDS and 67 pct of Hughes'
earnings.
    GM also said it will continue to repurchase shares of all
three classes of its common in connection with ongoing
requirements of various benefit plans.
    That buyback, it said, will involve about nine mln shares
of 1.66 dlr par value common and 2.5 mln shares each of class E
and H common in 1987.
    GM said the repuchased shares of its par value common will
be held in its treasury indefinitely for possible future

19377,"LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS","A group of Latin American and
Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
    Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added ""the region should
not be the one affected by the trade bills.""
    He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
and the budget deficit, and ""it is regrettable to solve it by a
trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.""
    Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
    Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
annual trade surpluses with the United States.
    Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
    The European Community has also opposed the bills.
    Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
    He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
on the Senate floor, expected next week.
    Rodriguez said ""the region needs trade to continue
development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
by trade legislation.""
    Rodriguez said: ""we need to keep the market opens -
especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
national development progress.""
    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
termed ""protectionist,"" and his aides now are mounting a effort
to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
legislation.
    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez
said as yet ""the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.""

its trade deficit and raised national living standards in 1986,
serious imbalances remain.

demand for consumer goods, especially from state firms, is too

    China needs to accumulate enormous funds for construction
in its initial stage of socialist modernisation and consumption
must match the available resources, he said.

because of the sharp fall in world oil prices, the rising cost

London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
monopolizes the business.
    It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
its telecommunications market.
    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
telephone and satellite communications market.
    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
sector it regulates.
    ""What has been happening is an important shift in the
economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said
James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
Service Inc.
    A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
    ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
legal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
Whitten.
    Close links with the powerful political faction of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
analysts said.
    ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
of MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
the influential political group, he added.
    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
Postal Savings System, analysts said.
    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
banks, they said.
    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
the ministry as feudal.
    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
including Britain, several analysts said.
    ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.
""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
view,"" he said.

10696,H.K. DEALERS SAY NAKASONE G-6 COMMENT TOO LATE,"Remarks by Japan's Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to
stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to
influence currency trading, dealers said.
    After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen
from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finish
of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering,
they said.
    ""I think (Nakasone's) desperate,"" said a U.S. Bank foreign
exchange manager.
    Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament
that Japan and other industrialized nations committed
themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above
150 yen.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee
that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar
fell below 150 yen.
    ""His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should
have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150
yen,"" said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust.
    Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  and
is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145
yen.
    Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S.
And Japan will continue to depress the dollar.
    The trade issue has now become a political issue since the
Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over

2833,DOME PETE&lt;DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR,"Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure
from one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,
energy industry analysts said.
    Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
pay down debt, analysts said.
    ""The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
direction that might make it a saleable asset,"" said one analyst
who asked not to be named.
    Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale ""at
the right price.""
    Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
Encor shares do not pay dividends.
    A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
    At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
    Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
    ""Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
recent weeks with a runup in crude prices,"" Peters and Co Ltd
oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
    ""The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
they have been able to in recent years,"" he added.
    Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
dlrs in early February.
    The company also recently set up its own operating
management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
    Dome and Encor ""are actually going to get farther apart. So
(the sale) does make a lot of sense,"" Mote said.
    However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
Commerce Bank.
    ""I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
they can,"" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
    Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
    ""Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
sold out from under them,"" said analyst Gobert.
    Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
    Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
    Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
debt and has a ""right of consent"" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
holding.
    Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
    Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share ""are very
attractive.""

3563,TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN,"The oil services industry is on the
verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil
industry analysts said.
    The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some
stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the
second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the
first half, and continue into the next decade.
     ""People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go
up to start buying,"" said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.
    Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>,
Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, Baker
International &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>,
which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a
Dallas-based investor.
    Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing
exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in
oil services will begin in the U.S.
    ""Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up
faster,"" said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.
    The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766
last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co
&lt;HT> figures show.
    The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is
projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge,
vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. ""The
first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the
second half of 1988,"" Kerridge said.
    Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar
pattern, Kerridge said.
    ""Halliburton is the best value,"" said Jeffrey Freedman,
vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding
the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common
stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess,
and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash
flow including debt.
    Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service
stock.
    ""Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant
technical leader in the industry,"" Freedman said.
    ""Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring,
including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its
considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to
maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on
the project upturn in exploration and development activity,""
according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at
Robert W. Baird and Co Inc.
    Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25
cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts
in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87
billion dlrs.
    Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil
service companies and said choosing among them is difficult.
Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a
possible merger with Hughes Tool Co.
    Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but
possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a
pure service company, Sweeney said.
    Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost
reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and
leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup.

Corp expects its new products and cost-cutting measures to have

    Akers repeated his assessment of the company's outlook when
first quarter results were announced last week that ""although
the worldwide economic situation remains unsettled, we see some
encouraging signs.""
    He said IBM shipments in the first quarter exceeded the
1986 level, ""the first time that has happened since 1985.""
    Akers said that IBM will increase its emphasis on service
and support of customers this year and that by the end of 1987
it will have 20 pct more sales representatives and systems
engineers than two years ago.
    He said the company is accomplishing this by both moving as
many existing employees as possible into marketing and through

thousands people over early 1985, to a yearend total of 26,000.
    Last year IBM announced that it would try to reduce its

12775,CLOSURE OF BP SWEDEN REFINERY FORECAST,"A Swedish Finance Ministry committee
forecast that British Petroleum Plc &lt;BP.L> may have to close
its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening
of the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness.
    It said in a report that the future of the Swedish refining
business was bleak due to the steady drop in domestic oil
consumption since the mid-1970s, a possible tightening of rules
on sulphur content and competition from Norway's Mongstad
facility of &lt;Den Norske Stats Olieselskab> (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>
when its expansion is completed in the 1990s.
    The committee said the BP refinery, which lacks a
de-sulphurisation plant, was likely to be closed or sold unless
costly investments were made to enhance the facility's capacity
to refine a broader range of products.
    But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in
recent years been above that of the European refining industry
on average. The BP plant, in which Sweden's state-owned &lt;OK
Petroleum AB> has a 22 pct, started up in 1967 and has an
annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes.

    He did not make any specific projections for the company's
earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of
not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed
four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.
    It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,
equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share
split.
    Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to
property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax
profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
    The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln
dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South
China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,
compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it

May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect
the British colony.
    He said all of the company's major operations showed
improved results in 1986.
    Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct
interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to
&lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from
Hongkong Electric.
    Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong
Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related
activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local

share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.
    Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares
from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.
    The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will
give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.
    Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve
Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for
making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from
the government for the spin-off.
    He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets

4946,U.S. FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT,"A secondary market for resale of
farm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages is
gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could
be set up this year, Congressional and financial sources said.
    Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market
have been introduced in both the House and Senate. Furthermore,
Representatives of the Farm Credit System, commercial bankers
and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree
on a method of establishing the market.
    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,
FCA, which regulates the farm credit system, yesterday said a
farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture
""as long as the farm credit system is a key player.""
    Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the
secondary market could be established either with Congressional
legislation or administratively.
    Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the
successful resale markets in home mortgages, the Government
National Mortgage Association, GNMA, and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), industry sources said.
    Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main
supporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe
it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in
rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system,
traditionally the largest lender to farmers.
    A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell
high-quality loans on farmland to ""poolers,"" who in turn would
package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for
resale to investors -- called Aggie-mae by some proponents.
    The FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have in
the past been ambivalent about the idea, mainly because any
farm secondary market established in the private sector which
excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a
competitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to
the system, which has lost 4.6 billion dlrs in two years,
Naylor and farm credit system officials have said.
    However, the system and FCA have become more positive to
the idea recently because the system could benefit if it were
appointed the agent for a secondary market.
    ""If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools
of farm mortgage loans, it would benefit from the fees charged
for providing this service,"" the Life Insurers' study said.
    Congressional sources believe a secondary market available
to both private lenders and the farm credit system, with the
system as agent, could be included in a major federal
government rescue package for the system to be drafted by
Congress later this year.
    A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the
secondary market idea, the American Council of Life Insurers,
concludes that the farm credit system's market share in rural
lending would fall if a secondary market were established.
    The study was released earlier today.
    The study said a secondary market could be established with
virtually no federal money if the government provided a
guarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private
co-insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses.
    It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the
eight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year
would qualify for the secondary market in the first few years,
expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea.
    The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who
meet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would
fall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market.
    The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why
leading U.S. farm organizations such as the American Farm
Bureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea.
    Proponents say a secondary market also would increase
liquidity in farm lending, and spread the risk of such loans.

&lt;KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory
1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to
18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.
    Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5
billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from
16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.
    Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's
weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price
falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.
    The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and
plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.
    Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering
business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had
underpinned machinery and component activities.
    An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the
trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order
figures.
    However, ""all business sectors contributed to the positive
results achieved in 1986,"" Krupp added, without giving details.
    Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks
from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9
billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of
orders against 40 pct in 1985.
    Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11
member companies which comprise the core area of the group,
rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.
    The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at
end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.
    Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by
three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.
    The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,
mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in
foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer
industries.
    The difficult market for sections and flats of quality
steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.
But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless
cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.

16876,NAKASONE'S SALES TAX PLAN SUFFERS ANOTHER DENT,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
unpopular sales tax plan suffered another dent today when
members of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) called for
time to be taken in dealing with the proposed sales tax, party
officials said.
    The call came in a resolution adopted by a group of some
150 LDP parliamentarians and secretaries, acting on behalf of
their parliamentarians, at a meeting at the LDP headquarters,
they said. The MPs represented seemed to Account for one-third
of LDP MPs.
    The group is an LDP voluntary organisation, called the
Parliamentarians' Research Society for Reestablishment of
Finances claiming a membership of about 300 MPs, they said.
    Meanwhle, Nakasone this evening hinted that his party might
be ready to accept some modification to the five-pct sales tax
proposal after the fiscal 1987 state budget plan was passed by
parliament. The LDP suffered a setback in last Sunday's local
elections because of the controvertial tax plan. The result
also undermined Nakasone's prestige, giving rise to a
possibility that he might be forced out of office before
October 30, when he is supposed to step down.

8940,KODAK &lt;EK> TO CUT POLYESTER FIBER OPERATIONS,"Eastman Kodak Co said it will
reduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber
operations of its Eastman Chemicals division.
    A company spokesman said the company will take ""some
writeoff"" in connection with the action in the first quarter
and there will probably be a further ""carryover"" writeoff in
the second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of
plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected
with the staff cuts.
    Kodak said the division will discontinue production of
polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its
Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100
mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,
mostly in Columbia.
    The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in
Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,
and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in
Kingsport, Tenn.
    Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved
through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan
for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products
Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense
Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be
completed by April 30.
    Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance
have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY
production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the
business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman
since last year.
    The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel
polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from
500 mln due to lesser demand.
    It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase
in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.
    Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport
units affected about 10,800.
    The company spokesman later said the charges will be
insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

7055,SWISSAIR PLANE ORDER FOR 1.2 BILLION SWISS FRANCS,"Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z> said that the order
for McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD> MD-11 long haul jets confirmed
this morning was worth a total 1.2 billion Swiss francs.
    President Robert Staubli told a news conference it had not
yet been decided whether the planes would have General Electric
Co &lt;GE.N>, Pratt and Whitney &lt;UTX> or Rolls Royce engines.
    The airline said it chose the U.S. Plane rather than the
rival A-340 of the European Airbus consortium because it met
better the Swissair requirements and would be able to enter
service in 1990 giving a smooth transition from the DC-10s it
replaces.
    Staubli said Swissair planned to have replaced its whole
fleet of 11 DC10s by 1992 at the latest, entailing the order of
five more long-haul planes in addition to the six announced
today. He said it would decide on the basis of the development
of traffic whether these five would be MD-11s or Boeing 747s.
    However, Staubli ruled out the possibility that Swissair
might eventually choose A-340s. ""We cannot afford to operate
three different types of aircraft,"" he said.
    Swissair also had no short term plans to exercise its
option to buy Airbus A-310s, of which it already operates nine,
officials said. But it would still hold the options open.
    Staubli declined to say how much it paid for each of the
MD-11s. The total 1.2 billion franc figure was not only for the
planes but also for spare parts and other related expenditure.
    Company officials said that Swissair intended to cover
around 75 pct of the costs of its entire DC-10 replacement
programme with internally generated funds. It hopes to raise
the remaining 25 pct on the Swiss and other capital markets
through issuing straight or equity related bonds and/or through
a capital increase.
    The first such bond issue would likely come this year, they

12521,MELLON &lt;MEL> SEES LARGE FIRST-QUARTER LOSS,"Mellon Bank Corp said it expects
to report a loss for the first quarter in the range of 55 mln
to 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share.
    The company also said it intends to reduce its second
quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts.
    Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the
first quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in
charge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-loss
reserve.
    It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash
basis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs.
    In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrs
or 2.13 dlrs a share.
    Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs and
increased provisions address four areas of concern in the
bank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,
developing countries, some basic industrial companies and
several commercial real estate businesses.
    Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first
quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct of
the loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct of
total loans at the end of 1986.
    Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the
first quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23
pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines.
    Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45
billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with
928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986.
    Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in
energy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lack
of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,
especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent to
increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector.
    ""This action relates both to loans to companies directly
involved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers,
home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern
United States,"" Barnes said.
    As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln
dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had
charged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt.
    He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quit
Brazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term credit
lines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and
other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts.
    Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to
the increase in non-performing assets or to first-quarter
charge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about the
absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries.
    The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continued
management cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has
the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties,
Barnes said.
    ""We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently
trouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing them
aggressively,"" he added.

6091,ANALYSTS SEE EARLY ONE POINT CUT IN U.K. BASE RATE,"British bank base lending rates are
likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this
week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K.
Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in
today's 1987 budget, bank analysts said.
    The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson's budget as cautious, a quality which currency and money
markets had already started to reward.
    Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money
market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget
measures came through, the analysts said.
    Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he
expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow.
    ""This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get
interest rates down,"" he said.
    Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely
discounted such a one point cut, with the key three month
interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night, and
it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a
half-point cut now.
    Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he,
too, expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday,
but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts.
    ""This budget is designed to please both the markets and the
electorate. The implications for interest rates are very
favourable, we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another
such cut before the end of the week,"" Simmonds said.
    Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday, he
said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut
in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target.
""There is no real need to boost private consumption,"" he said.
    National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said
the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the
likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut.
    Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully,
in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the
sharper than expected borrowing target cut, before a one-point
base rate cut could be implemented.
 But providing the budget small-print was convincing, ""and I
suspect it will be, it is entirely possible that we see one
point off base rates by the end of this week,"" Kern said.
    Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave
the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates.
This would help achieve Lawson's lower than expected consumer
price inflation target of four pct at end-1987, he said.
    U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11
pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange, money
and government bonds (gilts) markets.
    But building societies said they would not cut lending
rates until base rates had fallen by one full point.

18461,TAIWAN PARLIAMENT BACKS FREE CAPITAL OUTFLOWS,"Parliament approved a proposal to drop
all controls on capital outflows, raising the prospect that
Taiwan's vast resevoir of foreign exchange will flow into the
world economy.
    A government spokesman said the new law would be
promulgated by President Chiang Ching-Kuo within 10 days and
financial authorities would then be empowered to lift controls
on currency outflows at any time.
    Tight restrictions on capital inflows introduced this year
will remain in place, the spokesman said.
    Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-Cheng has said the controls
will be lifted at the end of next month or early in August.
    The central bank and finance ministry proposed lifting
currency restrictions to help reduce Taiwan's foreign exchange
reserves, which stand at about 60 billion U.S. Dlrs and have
led to runaway growth in money supply.
    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
West Germany, also draw attention to Taiwan's huge trade
surplus and the government fears they are making the island a
target for U.S. Trade protectionism.
    The surplus rose 34 pct to a record 7.32 billion U.S. Dlrs
in the first five months of this year and about 90 pct of it
was with the United States.
    Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.9 pct in the
year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
    Local bankers and economists say when the controls are
lifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency and
invest it freely overseas. But they warn against expectations
of a sudden outflow of capital.
    ""I don't think we're going to see a big bang,"" John Brinsden,
the Taiwan manager of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters in a
recent interview.
    Bankers said that businessmen have been holding vast
quantities of foreign exchange overseas for many years and also
have been freely buying and exporting currency through a
flourishing black-market.
    ""Obviously there will be an outflow of funds ... But I don't
think it's going to be much,"" said Danny Chan, director of
Fidelity Securities Investment Consulting Corp.
    Economists say the success of plans to encourage capital
outflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise of
the local currency.
    The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 23 pct against the
U.S. Dollar since September 1983, prompting an inflow of
speculative money. It rose by one Taiwan cent today to close at
31.08.
    The government spokesman said the new law does not empower
authorities to permanently lift capital controls, but any
proposal to reimpose them would need the approval of
parliament.
    Many economists believe that once the controls are lifted
it will be almost impossible to reimpose them.

    He said Iranians should guard against internal dissent and

""smash Islam...And destroy every one of us.""
    His audience at a Tehran mosque included President Ali
Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Hojatoleslam

fighting whom...These things have an impact, and if one does
not beg God for preservation from such evils, one may fall into
a trap.""
    Urging support for Parliament and the armed forces,
Khomeini said it was a ""religious duty"" to control negative
feelings about others and to behave in a friendly way.
    ""We must support the Majlis. The Majlis must take sides with
the nation. We must support the government and it must serve
the nation,"" he said. ""We must support the armed forces...They,
too, should support you.

of the Revolutionary Guards Corps and the Corps must support

5773,STRIKES AGAINST WAGE FREEZE SPREAD IN YUGOSLAVIA,"Strikes against a government freeze on
wages spread to most regions of Yugoslavia last week, the
official news agency Tanjug said last night.
    It said thousands of workers were involved, and officials
feared more strikes were on the way.
    At least 60 strikes have taken place around Yugoslavia in
the past two weeks, but most of those previously reported were
in the northern republic of Croatia.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic imposed the wage freeze last
month in an effort to curb rampant inflation, now running at an
annual rate of almost 100 pct.
    The government froze wages at their level in the fourth
quarter of 1986 and said any future rises must be linked to
productivity.
    The measure met widespread disapproval. Even some senior
executives of major industrial enterprises have criticised the
freeze in interviews with Tanjug.
    The agency said strikes took place last week in the
southern republic of Montenegro and the predominantly ethnic
Albanian province of Kosovo. In the central republic of Bosnia
and Hercegovina 1,700 workers struck, while many teachers in
Belgrade refused to take their paychecks.
    Earlier, Yugoslav journalists, who asked to remain
anonymous, told Reuters they had been barred from strike-hit
factories.
    They said they had been told they could not enter without
permits, whereas before the strikes no permits had been
necessary to visit factories.

15451,AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS,"Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>
reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
for 1987.
    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
due to its life insurance business.
    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
higher personal risks.
    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
investment influences that it should be accounted differently
from the more traditional insurances.
    This change in accounting practice and another change to
account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
guilders.
    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
Hague.
    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
profits.
    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
for Monumental Corp.
    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

10774,JAPAN CAREFULLY CONSIDERING MONEY POLICY - SUMITA,"Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary
policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar.
    Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in
its discount rate, he said he now thinks the bank will have to
carefully consider its future money policy.
    He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that
credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate
cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year.
    Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in
inflation, with money supply growth accelerating, he said.
    Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a
judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices,
exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in
and outside Japan.
    Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure
because the dollar had fallen too far, Sumita said he still
thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had
corrected the overvaluation of the dollar. But the Plaza accord
did not set any target for the dollar's fall, he said.
    The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that
the trade imbalance will continue to expand, he said.

17509,ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT,"The Zambian government today announced
minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new
economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the
northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.
    However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,
were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could
provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more
sweeping reductions.
    Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the
small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on
items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.
    Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said
government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.
    In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign
of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.
    President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take
account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the
kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.
    The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic
strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity
program.
    Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of
unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile
region to take action against shops that did not reduce their
prices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in
the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the
government tried to lift maize subsidies.

6998,EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN AS CONCESSION TO PRODUCERS,"The rebate granted at yesterday's EC
sugar tender represents some concession to producers'
complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the
bloc, EC Commission officials said.
    The maximum rebate of 44.819 European currency units (Ecus)
per 100 kilos was 1.3 Ecus below what producers say is needed
to obtain the equivalent price to that offered for sales into
intervention.
    The rebate at last week's tender was 2.5 Ecus per 100 kilos
short of the level producers said was needed, the officials
said.
    The officials said the Commission is not negotiating with
producers who have offered a total of 854,000 tonnes of sugar
for sale into intervention in an apparent attempt to persuade
it to offer higher rebates.
    They said the French and German producers involved are now
unable to withdraw this offer before April 1 when the sugar
will officially enter intervention stores.
    Payment for it is due five weeks later, and it will be open
to them to withdraw their offers at any time between April 1
and the official payment date when the Commission officially
takes ownership of the sugar, the officials said.
    The officials said if the Commission has to buy the sugar,
it is determined to immediately resell it, a move which would
drive down market prices further.
    They expressed some hope that the operators would not
eventually go through with their plan for intervention sales.
    ""We think they realise they have gone too far,"" one official
said.

quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same
1986 period, customs figures show.
    Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau,
quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28
billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.
    He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and
materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only
350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a
result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their
level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.
    Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs
at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.
    Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved
incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain
more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.
    He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose
35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46

19016,"OTTAWA WIDENS SALES TAX, STUDIES REPLACEMENT","Canada will broaden a federal sales tax
levied on manufacturers before scrapping the system in favor of
a broad based, multi-staged sales tax, finance minister Michael
Wilson said.
     As expected, Wilson did not include a new sales tax system
as part of his wide-ranging tax reforms tabled in the House of
Commons today.
    Instead, the federal government will make interim changes
to the existing sales tax to make it more fair for low and
middle income Canadians.
    ""The present (sales) tax is fundamentally flawed. It is a
hidden, arbitrary and capricious tax,"" Wilson told the House of
Commons.
    The existing federal sales tax system hurts the Canadian
economy by putting more tax on Canadian produced goods than
imported goods and adding a hidden tax on Canadian exports that
makes them less competitive, Wilson said.
     Interim changes effective January 1, 1988 will include:
     -- applying the federal sales tax to marketing companies
related to manufacturers
     -- levying the tax at the wholesale level instead of the
manufacturer for a selected range of products
     -- applying a 10 pct sales tax to telecommunication
services, except for residential telephone lines
     -- quicker collection of federal sales taxes.
     To offset these changes for low income Canadians,
refundable tax credits will be increased to 70 dlrs from 50
dlrs for adults and to 35 dlrs from 25 dlrs for children, the
finance department said.
     Ottawa is considering three alternative forms for a new
sales tax, including a goods and services tax, a value added
tax and a national sales tax that would combine existing
federal and provincial levies into one system, Wilson told the
House of Commons.
     He said the federal government will explore the
possibility of one national sales tax with Canada's 10
provincial governments. All provinces except Albeta now levy a
provincial sales of tax of varying amounts.
     Wilson said one joint system would be simpler for
taxpayers and maximize economic benefits of tax reform.
     If Ottawa and the provinces can't agree on a national
sales tax system, Wilson said the federal government will
consider either a goods and services tax or a value-added tax.
     A goods and services tax would apply at one rate to
virtually all goods and services in Canada and would include
further increases in refundable tax credits for low and middle
income Canadians, the finance department said in documents
accompanying Wilson's speech.
     A federal value-added tax, similar to European tax
systems, would also be broad based but would allow more
flexibility to exempt selected goods and services, the
department said. The finance deparment said the main drawback
of a value added tax is that it would be more complex and
costly to implement than the other two proposals.

9150,SINGAPORE SECURITIES MARKET CONSIDERING CHANGES,"The Stock Exchange of Singapore Ltd
is looking at a new settlement and clearing system and a
corporate disclosure format that would make financial data more
readily available, George Teo, deputy chairman of the exchange,
said.
    He told a conference organised by the Development Bank of
Singapore Ltd that Singapore wants to develop the fixed rate
securities market. He said a state securities market, along the
same lines as the U.S. Government securities market, will be
developed to provide a benchmark for corporate bonds.
    Teo said the fixed rate securities market will pave the way
for companies to raise fixed rate funds.
    Referring to a proposed change in the broking commission
structure, Teo said the exchange is likely to introduce a
sliding scale structure instead of a negotiated commission
structure. He said the negotiated structure works against small
investors, who play an important role in the market.
    The market capitalisation of the Stock Exchange of
Singapore increased to 42 billion U.S. Dlrs in January 1987
from 32 billion U.S. Dlrs in early 1986, he said.
    Teo said the government has picked 15 companies to
participate in a privatisation program which strives to create
opportunities for investors through the sale of 380 mln dlrs
worth of shares a year. It will try to increase alternative
investment available to investors, he said.
    He cautioned against problems in a more competitive
securities market, adding that the possibility of insider
trading is increased when securities dealing, corporate finance
and investment advisory functions are conducted under one roof.
But he said the future direction of Singapore's securities
industry will be dictated by international trends.

formed by &lt;Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe IV> for either
16.50 dlrs in cash or 10.00 dlrs in cash and a unit of
securities per Comdata share.
    The company said each unit of securities would consist of
1.25 common shares in the new company and three dlrs principal
amount of the new company's 11 pct subordinated debentures due
1997.
    It said the 16.50 dlr cash alternative is an improvement
over the 15.00 dlr per share price contemplated under an
agreement in principle with Welsh Carson announced on March
Five.
    Comdata said the cash and securities alternaitcve is
subject to Welsh Carson-affiliated investors owning at least 60
pct of the stock of the new company.
    The company said investment bankers &lt;Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc> and Alex. Brown and Sons Inc &lt;ABSB> found the proposal to
be fair from a financial point of view.
    It said the transaction is subject to approval by its
shareholders and to Welsh Carson obtaining up to 230 mln dlrs
in debt financing. Comdata said it may terminate the agreement
if financing is not arranged by April Three.
    On Thursday, First Financial Management Corp &lt;FFMC> offered
to acquire Comdata for 18.00 dlrs per share in stock and cash,
subject to approval by the Comdata board.
    Under the First Financial proposal, Comdata holders would
receive no more than four dlrs per share in cash and could
receive all stock.
    Comdata had originally planned a recapitalization under
which it would have repurchased up to six mln common shares at

    In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had no
knowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the
cabinet.
    Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to

    Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy
U.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, ""If they
(the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we accept
it? It would depend on what price they offered.""
    Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat
was far off the world price.

6815,GENCORP &lt;GY> GROUP TO SEEK ANTI-GREENMAIL VOTE,"GAMCO Investors Inc, an affiliate of
Gabelli and Co, plans to propose an anti-greenmail provision at
the GenCorp Inc annual meeting March 31, according to GAMCO
Chairman Mario Gabelli.
    Greenmail often involves the repurchase of shares at a
premium by a company from an unwanted investor. GenCorp today
received a surprise tender offer from a group that holds 9.8
pct of its stock.
    Gabelli also said GAMCO has sent a 13-D filing to the
Securities and Exchange Commission on the 6.5 pct of GenCorp
stock held by GAMCO and its affiliates.
    The stock amounts to 1,462,000 shares and most of it was
reported in an earlier 13-G filing. A 13-G is filed by passive
investors to show holdings of more than five pct.
    Earlier today, General Partners, owned by Wagner and Brown
and AFG Industries Inc, launched a 100 dlr per share tender
offer for GenCorp. Analysts said the offer was between 10 and
20 dlrs per share too low.
    GenCorp has made no comment on the offer.
    Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider
spinning off all assets, other than the GenCorp broadcast
properties, to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcast
properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges.
    ""One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going to
the meeting and putting up ""no greenmail,"" Gabelli said.
    Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation
in the offer.
    The annual meeting is to be held in Akron, Ohio.

1990,EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING,"OPEC crude oil output in the first few
days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16
mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.
    The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil
traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle
East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
    They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the
group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.
    OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd
above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.
    The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,
was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the
survey reveals.
    But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran""s inability to
export as much as its quota allows.
    Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced
1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.
    Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to
3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,
against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a
200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.
    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was
estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in
early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share
of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.
    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,
both substantially under quota in February and early March.
    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to
180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar""s
prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.
    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down
from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.
    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny
grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes
from the U.K. North Sea.

17395,SWISS PREPARED TO INCREASE CURRENCY INTERVENTION,"The Swiss National Bank is
prepared to increase its intervention on currency markets if
the action can be properly coordinated with other central
banks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three man
directorate, said.
    He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that intervention
to support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes in
exchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes in
economic policy.
    However, intervention could send signals that would
contribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements.
    The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperation
with other central banks, especially where convincing
coordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lusser
said.
    He said currency developments could not simply be talked
into existence but needed to be matched by actions in the field
of economic policy.
    ""Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise the
dollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit and
a slowdown in money supply growth in the United States are
unavoidable,"" he said.
    The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedly
in the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it had
intervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since last
October.
    Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stability
lay not in currency intervention by central banks but only in
an improvement in international economic policy coordination.
    This meant that industrial countries must avoid abrupt
switches in economic policy and give priority to price
stability.
    Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the view
that easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatible
with its primary goal of combatting inflation. The bank target
is for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987.
    He noted that in 1978, when the Swiss franc rose sharply
against all currencies, the bank was forced to abandon its
money supply targets in favour of an exchange rate target, with
the result that inflation surged.
    ""Current exchange rate developments have not, until today at
any rate, made any such measures by the National Bank
necessary,"" he said.

429,TAIWAN TO SEEK HIGHER TEXTILE EXPORTS TO U.S.,"A Taiwan mission will leave next week for
Washington to renegotiate an agreement severely limiting the
growth of the island's textile exports, a Board of Foreign
Trade official said.
    Under the agreement signed last July, Taiwan's textile
export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988,
based on the value of 1985 exports.
    The official said the pact was unfair because the United
States had signed more favourable agreements with Hong Kong and
South Korea. They were each given about one pct growth until
1991.
    He said Taiwan now found it difficult to compete with its
two main rivals and the problem had been made worse because of

16061,TORONTO FINANCIAL DISTRICT HIT BY POWER OUTAGE,"Toronto's financial district, the

after being struck by a power blackout, utility and business

    The blackout occurred around 1515 EDT in about an
eight-square-block section of the city's downtown core, home to
most of the city's skyscrapers, containing the  headquarters of
many of Canada's major corporations and financial institutions.
    Ontario Hydro spokeswoman Christina Warren told Reuters the
blackout occurred when a transformer cable went down during
routine maintenance at a downtown hydroelectricity station.
Power was restored after 10 minutes.
    The power loss halted floor trading for 15 minutes on the
Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's largest equity market,
although computerized trading - accounting for about 20 per
cent of the Exchange's normal volume - continued, Toronto Stock

    Bank operations were also affected. The headquarters or
major offices of Canada's six major banks line a small section
of Bay Street, the Wall Street of Canada.
    Bank of Montreal spokesman Brian Smith told Reuters the
blackout shut down electronic banking machines and caused a
minor slowdown in money trading operations, although ""all in all
we were not seriously affected.""
    Officials at various downtown skyscrapers said the blackout
also briefly shut down elevators and disrupted business in the

3155,"RUBBER PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS START NEW PACT TALKS","The chairman of the conference on a new
International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), Manaspas Xuto of
Thailand, said it was imperative to try to settle the main
outstanding issues this week.
    The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today
under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development (UNCTAD), is scheduled to last until March 20.
    Xuto told delegates this session of the conference
presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it
had to be the last before the current accord expires in
October.
    Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of
major exporting and importing countries over the last few
months, ""I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to
be flexible on the part of all concerned.""
    ""It is imperative that we try to settle the major
outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a
considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to
be completed."" He said he will immediately start consultations
with producers and consumers.
    The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement
over buffer stock operations.
    Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed
at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the
International Tin Agreement (ITA), were rejected by producers
who argued for unchanged INRA terms.
    The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out
of funds to support prices.
    Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and
consumers for a new five-year pact ended without agreement. The
INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to
October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation.
    Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he
was cautiously optimistic ""that together we should be able to
save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled.""
    Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would
become more volatile.
    Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and
reality, he said, ""There is no reason why we could not put aside
differences and come up with a successor agreement.""

10553,U.S. PRICE DATA SUGGEST MODERATE INFLATION,"Latest consumer price data indicate
U.S. inflation will be moderate in 1987 even though it will be
above last year's pace, economists said.
    ""Inflation is not such a constructive factor as this time
last year, but it's not building up a large head of steam,""
said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the consumer price
index for all urban consumers, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4
pct in February after a 0.7 pct January gain. Energy prices,
which fired January's data with a three pct rise, advanced a
more moderate 1.9 pct last month.
    The CPI came within the range of economists' expectations
and had little direct impact on U.S. financial markets.
    Among the key components of the report, transportation
prices rose 0.5 pct in February after a 1.5 pct January gain
reflecting smaller price appreciation for motor fuels and
declines in new car prices and finance charges.
    ""There are no pronounced pressures at the retail level,""
said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
    Economists said the latest CPI supports existing
expectations for an inflation rate of 3.5 to four pct in 1987.
    The CPI rose 1.1 pct from December 1985 to December 1986.
Without last year's energy price drop, it rose 3.8 pct.
    Economists said that upward pressure on import prices as a
result of the dollar's drop as well as the volatile energy
component warrant attention in case gains in these areas become
factored into the wider economic picture.
    ""As long as those price rises do not become entrenched in
cost of living adjustments contained in labor contracts, thus
reducing international competitiveness, then the Federal
Reserve would probably be willing to tolerate four pct
inflation,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.

sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe
Generale &lt;STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary &lt;Societe Generale
Alsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL
officials said.
    SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the
leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria,
Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.
    Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share
offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance
Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.
    Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later
this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the
bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.
    SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated
group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160
mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.
    SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital
increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln
francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight,
giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.
    The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in
line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a
regional operation, Geronimus said.
    He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around
30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten
pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees
with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share
reserved for foreign investors. ""This is too small an operation
and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,"" he said.
    Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of
120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.
    Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce
its existing strong points, with no major projects planned
apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch.
    SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the
first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its

prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
efforts to achieve further firming of the price led to growing
inflationary pressures in the U.S., The world's biggest crude
oil producer.
    Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed
the central banks' limits and real growth of their gross
national products, it said.
    Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased
industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank
said.
    Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on
futures markets, has also risen. These factors and South
Africa's unstable political situation, which may lead to a
temporary reduction in gold supplies from that country,
underline the firmer sentiment, it said.
    However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90
tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.

9022,DOLLAR EXPECTED TO FALL DESPITE INTERVENTION,"Central bank intervention in the
foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's
losses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency
is headed for a further retreat.
    Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive
that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of
commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies.
    Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over
the currency market than central bank intervention and these
argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said.
    ""The market can be bigger than the central banks. And
economic fundamentals will always come to the fore,"" said a
dealer at one major U.S. bank.
    As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the
yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,
Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the
markets on behalf of the U.S. currency.
    Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar
recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from
the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still
failed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.
    Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5
billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars
yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.
    Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the
Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen
today. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased
a small amount of dollars for yen.
    The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28
when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of
Japan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have
signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.
    The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February
22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate
to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.
    But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by
the authorities' intervention which they said can only soften
extreme moves in the market.
    For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed's
purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than
for the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather  
watered-down American commitment to the currency accord.
    The Bank of England's action also was thought to be
completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing
the market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six
nations in its support of the currency pact.
    ""No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other
two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than
anything else,"" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.
    ""I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted,"" said
Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. 
""It's a yen problem more than anything else.""
    Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist
sentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American
authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.
    ""The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the
Treasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on
its own account because of the strength of protectionism here,""
said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.
    Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets
are becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official
denials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a
lower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit.
    The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade
deficit in 1986 was with Japan.
    Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment on
Sunday that the February currency pact had not established
dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the
U.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.
    ""The dollar still has more room on the downside against the
yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The
currency market is becoming very political,"" said Natsuo Okada
of Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
    Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen
this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end
of April or early May.
    Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their
economies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic
imbalances in the near future, dealers said.
    ""Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it
won't be enough to help the trade situation much,"" said
Bourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to
148 yen in the next couple of days.

10607,TEST HITCH INTERRUPTS ARIANE MOTOR TRIALS,"An error interrupted testing of an Ariane
rocket third stage starter motor on Monday but there should be
little or no delay in the launch program, Arianespace said.
    A joint statement from the European Arianespace consortium
and the motor manufacturer Societe Europeenne de Propulsion
(SEP) said that to avoid any risk, the motor had been
dismantled and could not be used in the next launch.
    It had immediately been replaced by another motor and new
tests had begun today.
    ""In these conditions, the flight V19 remains scheduled
before the end of June,"" the statement said.
    Ariane launches have been suspended since an ignition
failure in the third stage motor last May forced controllers to
blow up a rocket in flight.
    SEP has been carrying out a series of nearly 50
simulated-altitude tests on the redesigned starter at its
tightly guarded plant in the town of Vernon, 80 km northwest of
Paris.
    The Arianespace-SEP statement said that during a test on
March 23, a fault in the preparation of the altitude simulation
chamber meant a component of the motor came under abnormal
pressure.
    Arianespace originally hoped to resume launches by February
this year, but a longer-than-expected test program on the new
starter motor forced postponement of the next launch.
    The total orderbook of outstanding launches for the
13-member European Space Agency's Ariane rockets runs to more
than 40 satellites and is worth more than two billion dlrs.
    The Ariane program is the main rival to the United States'
NASA agency in the lucrative satellite launch market. Its
orders have sharply increased largely as a result of the U.S.
Space shuttle disaster in January 1986.

16216,SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW>,"Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has
raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each
from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking
to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.
    In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his
MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration
period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had
been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he
had received a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to the
offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.
    Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln
common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a
primary basis.
    Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan
as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders
would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject
to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in
June.
    The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln
dlrs in debt to finance the payout.
    Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the
amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to
give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on
the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New
Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.
    He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all
of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a
merger transaction.
    Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares
he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,
would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.
    He said he still has received only a ""negligible"" number of
shares in response to his tender.
    In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in
the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April
8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
increase the price of his offer.
    Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
place.
    Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered
to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding
Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.
    He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a
syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
purchase of shares under the offer.
    Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,
or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
independent investment baking firm.
    He said ""To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value
of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.""
    Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
Caesars' recapitalization.
    Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming
officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory
process required for regulatory approval, a process that it
already underway in New Jersey.
    He said his offer has been extended based on the likely
duration of the regulatory process.
    He said he intends to further extend the offer if the
approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

9658,LOMAC TO PAY COSTS IN FIRST SUPERFUND AGREEMENT,"Lomac Inc, a publicly traded
company, will pay the U.S. and Michigan governments to help
clean up a toxic waste site in the first major settlement under
the 1986 Superfund-Two act, Michigan officials said.
    Lomac will pay 17 mln dlrs to help clean the site, they
said.
    Stewart Freeman, Michigan's chief environmental attorney,
told Reuters that Lomac, a new company, agreed to buy a
chemical site near Muskegon, Mich., formerly operated by Bafors
Nobel Inc, a bankrupt subsidiary of A.B. Nobel of Sweden.
    The settlement was also the largest in history in a
bankruptcy case involving environmental issues, Freeman said.
    Other companies with Superfund disputes are watching the
case closely, he said. ""There are a number of very large
corporations talking to the attorney general,"" Freeman said,
referring to Michigan Atty. Gen. Frank J. Kelley.
    Freeman would not identify the companies involved, saying
he was not sure whether confidentiality agreements had been
made.
    Lomac will pay 25-26 mln dlrs in the settlement. Five mln
dlrs will be paid to the federal and 12 mln dlrs will go to the
Michigan government for cleanup at the site, the Lakeway
Chemical plant.
    The remaining funds will go to medical surveillance of
former workers at the plant.
    Under the agreement, a trust fund will be set up ""to
monitor the health of employees who may have been exposed to
dangerous chemicals that were manufactured at the plant before
1971,"" the Michigan attorney general's office said in a
statement.
    Freeman said the medical fund was necessary because of
possible medical problems among workers at the site.
    The Muskegon facility was formerly used to manufacture
dyes. Freeman said Bofors Nobel spent 50 mln dlrs cleaning up
the site, formerly owned by Lakeway Chemical Co, before ""the
economic decision was made in Sweden"" to place the operation in
bankruptcy.
    Under the agreement, Bofors Nobel will sell the site, which
still holds an operating chemical plant, to Lomac. Some 150
employees work at the plant, a spokesman for the Michigan
attorney general said.
    The state attorney general said cleanup at the site will
begin ""immediately,"" and will be supervised by federal and
state officials.
    Freeman said the plant site is not presently listed on the
federal superfund list, which qualifies the toxic waste site
for federal cleanup funds.
    He said federal officials will try to get the Muskegon
facility onto the superfund list. If they are unable to do so,
the 5.0 mln dlr federal portion of the settlement will be
turned over to Michigan officials to be used in the cleanup,
Freeman said.

17206,EC MINISTERS LIKELY TO CRITICISE FINANCE IDEAS,"Plans for a new-style European
Community (EC) free of damaging budget wrangles receive their
first full review from EC foreign ministers today, but are
unlikely to gather much support.
    Diplomats said key EC capitals would voice strong criticism
of proposals that would lead to a sharp increase in EC budget
payments by bringing member states"" contributions more into line
with national wealth.
    They said the EC""s current paymasters, Britain, France, and
West Germany, would lead the opposition to the plans, designed
to enable the community meet the challenges of the 1990s.
    Faced with a budget deficit this year of at least five
billion dlrs, EC Commission President Jacques Delors called in
February for a radical overhaul of the EC financing system.
    Such action was necessary, he argued, to end a damaging
cycle of annual budget crises and ensure cash for technological
research programs and regional and social spending projects.
    Ironically, diplomats said, the move could spark exactly
the type of row it was intended to avoid with industrially
developed northern states demanding assurances the new cash
would not be swallowed up by the poorer southern members.
    Delors"" plans, by linking a country""s contributions to its
Gross National Product (GNP), would over the next five years
add some 18 billion dlrs to the present budget of 34 billion.
    Currently, contributions are calculated on a percentage of
Value Added Tax (VAT) returns.
    Under the new scheme, all countries would pay one pct of
their VAT receipts to Brussels. Extra cash would then be raised
in line with needs by a levy on the difference between a
country""s total VAT receipts and its GNP.
    London is one of the most resolutely opposed countries to
the scheme, arguing instead that money should be made available
from deep cutbacks in the EC""s heavily-subsidised farm sector.
    Unofficially many EC capitals secretly support the
wearisome budget wrangling, taking the line that the highly
diverse 12-nation Community can only take tough decisions when
forced to do so.
    The issue is further complicated by a possible general
election in Britain and acceptance that the EC problems cannot
seriously be addressed by London until those polls are out of
the way.

1959,GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT,"The outlook for the West
German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
University's Institute for World Economy said.
    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
    ""The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
all, limited,"" the report said. ""On the contrary, a slight rise
in exports can be expected.""
    The institute said past experience has shown West German
exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
their product ranges.
    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
this year.
    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
policy, the institute said.
    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
agreed reductions in working hours.
    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
acceleration of inflation.
    It also warned that what it called the worldwide
synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
Reserve Board's expansionary course.
    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
increase protectionism around the world.
    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
growth at home.
    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
to about four pct.

5168,IVORY COAST CONFIRMS PRESENCE AT COCOA TALKS,"A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture
Ministry official confirmed his country's backing for a new
international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be
present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week.
    The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister
Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened
by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on
Monday.
    While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral
ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country's capital
Yamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will
be present throughout the London talks, the official said.
    Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that
he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public
mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low
world cocoa prices Friday.
    The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new
pact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the
world's cocoa exporters and consumers.
    He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO
Council chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March
27.
    The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the
pact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market
hit by successive world cocoa surpluses.
    Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international
cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked
hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices.

8151,AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SAYS AGRICULTURE GATT PRIORITY,"Australian Trade Minister
John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform
it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis.
    In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers
conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves
all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing
abilities of a number of developing countries.
     He said major countries should be showing leadership on
this problem.
    ""We will be giving close attention to the processes in the
OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and
elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will
be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to
agricultural trade reform,"" Dawkins said.
    The Venice summit is scheduled for June.
    He said Australia's interests in the Uruguay Round, the
eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees
the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further
meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore
confidence in the multilateral system.
    Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups
established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September
in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but
it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these
processes.
    ""We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on
standstill and rollback are carried into practice.""
    The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global
trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during

1377,AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA,"The Australian Government will likely
reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)
dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
around 98 dlrs per tonne.
     For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5
mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
breakeven export price, it said.
    Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated
at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
department said.
    In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.
    But the department said the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will
drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
1989/90.
    The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.
wheat exports, the department said.

stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a ""dominant""
holding, an Italian government committee ruled.
    The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings,
headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision
reflected the ""need to safeguard the principle of separation
between banks and non-financial concerns.""
    It did not quantify what might constitute a ""dominant""
holding.
    The committee also set conditions for the allocation of
credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in
them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy
could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held
by banks in companies or other banks.
    Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their
subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more
of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits.
    The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth
of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or
two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the
group or individual concerned.
    Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns
in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign
banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to
subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be
excluded from the conditions.
    The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in
their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding
five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged
treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.
    With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of
Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a
bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a
company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or
indirectly.
    Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held
is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.
    The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value
of the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two
predefined limits.
    These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the
total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.

12650,EYSKENS SAYS US PRIME RISES WILL AID CURRENCIES,"Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens
warmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates,
calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and Canada
Paris accord on stabilising currencies.
    The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy
convergence among major countries, he added.
    In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear he
believed the countries involved in the accord - the U.S.,
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - had agreed
""tentative"" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates.
    Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of
European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in
Belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary
situation and proposals for strengthening the European Monetary
System (EMS).
    Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets,
Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving ""more
or less workable"" despite what he called evident disagreements
over U.S. Economic and monetary policy between Treasury
Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker.
    Besides Baker's public statements that had dramatically
influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.And
Japan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against the
yen, he said.
    But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo could
reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. ""I
think agreement is quite possible,"" he said.
     Eyskens said he was ""very agreeably surprised"" by this
week's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite the
obvious negative consequences for debtor countries.
    ""It is a positive element which goes further than the
(Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account of
its content,"" he said.
    He added that coordination of interest rates was a
fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence
between leading industrialised economies.
    ""A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation
ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a
more coordinated policy of interest rates,"" he said.
    Eyskens made clear he believed the G-6 countries had agreed
in Paris on ranges in which to hold their currencies.
    He said the end of the February 22 Louvre accord, in which
the partners agreed to cooperate closely to foster exchange
rate stability around current levels, clearly alluded to a
""system of tentative (fluctuation) margins.""
    He added the meeting and the statement would have been
meaningless if the G-6 had not discussed the technicalities of
implementing it.
    Eyskens said there was growing economic convergence among
leading industrialised countries pointing towards greater order
in the international monetary system.
    ""That doesn't mean we are ready to restore Bretton Woods
(the post-World War Two system of fixed exchange rates), but
within the (International Monetary Fund) Interim Committee we
are thinking in terms of target zones, fluctuation ranges to be
implemented and defended,"" he said.
    The Interim Committee meets next week in Washington ahead
of the IMF's Spring meetings, and Eyskens said the EC ministers
would prepare for the gatherings at this weekend's talks.
    He said he hoped for wide-ranging talks on the future of
the EMS at the weekend meeting, based on proposals from the
EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors
for strengthening the system through technical and
institutional changes.
    Eyskens said he expected EC Commission President Jacques
Delors to submit proposals for fully liberalising capital
movements within the 12-nation bloc and made clear he shared
Delors' view that this must be accompanied by a reinforcement
of the EMS. ""Both are totally linked. Liberalisation without
strengthening the EMS would destabilise the Community,"" he said.

20474,SOVIET 1988 OIL OUTPUT TARGET AT 625 MLN TONNES,"The Soviet oil production target for 1988
has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over
this year's planned output.
    Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday
at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
    He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an
upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation
which began in late 1983.
    Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,
slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.
    January-September figures released at the weekend showed
Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467
mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.
    Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil
deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog
prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.
    The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988
budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.

10228,OIL EXECUTIVES SEE GRADUAL RISE IN PRICES,"Top executives with Tenneco Corp &lt;TGT>
and Sabine Corp &lt;SAB> said they expected world oil prices to
gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on
imports of oil from the Middle East grows.
     ""I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a
trend of gradually increasing prices,"" C.W. Nance, president of
Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the
Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association.
     Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of
Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the
rate of 80 pct of capacity.
    The gain will come largely through increased imports to the
United States, he said.
    ""They will be able to raise the price again but I do not
think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,"" Nance
said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected.
     Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted
that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20
dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in
1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb
from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between
1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988.
     ""Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in
increased demand,"" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's
outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law
prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants
and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15
pct, he said.
     Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may
experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next
winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability.
     Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20
pct during 1986, he said.
     ""This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,"" Nance said.
""We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is
how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three
years before we start to climb out?""
      J.C. Walter of &lt;Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent
improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent
producers to begin new onshore drilling projects.
     ""If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr
per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore
exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by
independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,"" Walter said.
     He suggested that some independents may instead turn to
exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out
agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held
finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel,
Walter said.

opinion poll published since her return from the Soviet Union.

8195,BAKER WARNS AGAINST FORGIVENESS OF LATIN DEBT,"U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said
any attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major Latin
American debtor nations might damage the world economy.
    In an article in Monday's edition of the Miami Herald,
Baker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief,
calling it a ""dramatic, overnight solution.""
    ""While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have some
political appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive in
the long run,"" he said.
    The article was published to coincide with a three-day
meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).
    Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on Third
World debt.
    Brazil, the Third World's largest debtor, last month
declared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given no
indication of when it may resume interest payments, prompting
fears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantial
debt writedowns and calling into question the viability of the
U.S. Strategy.
    Baker, defending the strategy, said private commercial
banks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt since
October 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.
    ""Together with expected progress in commercial bank
discussions with Argentina and, we hope, Brazil, this should
add up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtors
in 1987,"" Baker wrote.
    He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accounted
for 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region's major
debtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sell
Third World debt at a discount to investors who then become
stockholders in firms in these countries. ""These swaps aren't a
panacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market can
make progress in reducing the debt burden,"" he said.

20511,EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA,"The European Community (EC) agreed a
trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
officials said.
    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
officials said.
    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade).
    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
been affected by the country's EC membership.
    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
fish dispute with Canada.
    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
with Japanese offers of compensation.
    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
journalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
concessions were not enough.""

19898,NEGOTIATIONS RESUME IN CANADIAN POSTAL STRIKE,"Negotiations resumed in the 14-day-old
strike by Canada's letter carriers and picket line violence
subsided after the federal government changed its mind and
appointed a mediator.
    The talks between the 20,000-member Letter Carriers Union
of Canada and government-owned Canada Post were the first since
Labor Minister Pierre Cadieux announced the appointment of a
mediator yesterday.
   
    There had been little progress between the parties last
week and both sides requested a mediator for the second time.
Cadieux originally said the two sides were too far apart to
warrant the help on an independent third party.
    Although the postal union said it would maintain its
strategy of selected rotating strikes across the country, only
the Montreal area was affected today and service was normal
elsewhere in Canada.
   
    Canada Post stuck by its promise to halt the use of
replacement workers for at least seven days if a mediator was
appointed and there were no reports of picket line violence.
    Canada Post, under government orders to eliminate a $160
million (U.S.) deficit by next year, has taken a tough stand in

Alliance with 31.5 pct and Labour with 29.5 pct.

    Last month a Marplan poll gave the Tories 38 pct, the

11204,"CHINA REFORMS TO TAKE DECADES, NO ALTERNATIVE","China's economic reforms will take
decades to fulfill and will outlast the life of any leader
because they are the only way to save the country from poverty,
an economist in one of the country's top think tanks told
Reuters.
    But He Weiling, Washington representative of the China
Economic System Reform Institute, said China's economic reforms
definitely are not at risk from the nationwide drive since
January against ""bourgeois liberalism,"" a phrase meaning Western
political ideas.
    He said ""bourgeois liberalism"" is not affecting departments
dealing with economics.
    His is one of a small number of key institutes, set up in
the early 1980s, which formulate economic reform policies and
advise the top leadership on them.
    Discussing subjects raised in the budget speech last week,
which put the 1986 and 1987 deficits at more than 15 billion
yuan because of excessive consumer demand and capital
construction plus falling efficiency in state firms, He said
reform of state firms and the financial system is the key goal
for 1987.
    ""The most difficult thing is to strike the balance between
making them independent units and the need for central control,""
He said.
    ""We are exploring ways of doing this, through joint stock
ownership, leasing, factory management responsibility systems
or in other ways,"" he added.
    One of the most serious problems facing China's leaders is
how to curb excess investment in capital construction,
especially in projects outside the state plan.
    He said this problem is chronic in all socialist economies.
    This is because firms are judged on output, not
profitability or efficiency.
    ""Firms use every excuse to get money and materials. They say
they want money to build offices but in fact use it to build
apartments, which is unauthorised,"" He said.
    ""Also, it is not good to report profits, which would mean
higher tax payments. It is better to report a loss,"" he added.
    He said China's state firms are continuing a 5,000-year-old
tradition when they under-report their assets in order to
reduce claims on them by higher authority.
    He said China will have to improve auditing, economic
regulations and the tax system, which he described as ""chaotic,""
especially at the lower levels, in order to deal with
under-reporting.
    ""Another important step is to further develop the money
markets to give firms an opportunity to invest. They need
channels for this which they do not have now. Without this,
there will be no genuine supply and demand for money,"" he said.
    As a reform to encourage efficiency, China now supplies
state firms with loans instead of grants as in the past.
    But He said the reforms have not resulted in much real
change because the loans carry low-interest. ""So some efficient
firms have not been able to get money from banks.""
    Price reform has been one of the most sensitive aspects of
the reform programme. Widespread discontent over price rises
forced the government to promise in January that there will be
no major increases in 1987.
    He said the price of steel, timber and cement and other
industrial raw materials only will ""rise gradually"" this year.
    Large-scale price adjustments would have an adverse
psychological impact and create social discontent.
    ""We must preserve unity and popular support,"" he said, but
""sometimes, the common people must make a sacrifice, like those
of Germany and Japan after 1945.""
    He said restrictions on a wide range of prices, including
most farm and light industrial products, have been lifted and
many intermediate pricing schemes scrapped over the last eight
years.
    ""It will take at least 15 to 20 years to complete an
overhaul of the price system. We must move carefully. We have
no model to work from and have only ourselves to rely on,"" He
said.
    He said the greatest fear expressed by foreigners is that
reform and open-door policies will not survive the death of
certain elderly leaders.
    He did not name top leader Deng Xiaoping, 82, the chief
architect of both policies since 1979.
    ""These fears are unfounded. The two policies have already
become the basic national policy of China. The reforms are
irreversible. China is one of the poorest 25 countries in the
world. Without the reforms, how are we to escape from this
poverty?""

Richter scale caused widespread damage in northern New Zealand
and a civil defence emergency was declared in some areas,
officials and seismologists said.
    There were no immediate reports of casualties. The quake
jolted the Bay of Plenty and Waikato areas.
    The town of Whakatane was said by officials to be virtually
isolated.
    A civil defence emergency was declared in Whakatane which
has about 16,000 people. Officials said many roads and bridges
in the area had been damaged.
    No deaths were reported but one man was admitted to
hospital in serious condition after his car was buried in a mud
slip.
    Seismologists said Whakatane was hit by three earthquakes,
the strongest measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale. They were
followed by a series of aftershocks.
    The quakes were felt across the Bay of Plenty and Waikato
regions in the northeast of the North Island.
    Smaller tremors had been felt in the Bay of Plenty for more
than a week.
    Police said many districts lost power supplies and
telephone links.
    Energy Ministry officials ordered the release of water

3352,MINISTERS FEEL EC FORECASTS TOO PESSIMISTIC,"European Community finance ministers
discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many
said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too
pessimistic.
    The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago
cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3
per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.
    It said economic prospects had been less promising over the
past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the
dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would
restrain Community exports.
    But diplomats said several member states, led by West
Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy,
especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement
between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise
currencies around current levels.
    ""Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather
too pessimistic,"" said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens,
who chaired the meeting.
    The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West
Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it
feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to
stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.
    But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto
Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at
the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy.

to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a
year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.
    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for
poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef
cattle raising, Ministry officials said.
    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87
against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were
217,554 tonnes against 224,101.
    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes
from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.
    The officials said corn imports rose because the world
surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced
Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in
1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.
    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87
from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from
18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due
to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as
Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.
    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and
the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.
    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from
increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.
    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against
528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct

    Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
obtained confidential information about the company to make its
offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of
Canada, were to succeed.
    Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS> by one dlr per share.
Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
    Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
""kill the offer""
    Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
were granted. ""There's only one Burlington,"" he said. ""If we
cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us.""
    Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in
Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. ""We don't want that. We're not in
this for the money,"" he said.
    Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that
information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington
executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o
takeover of Burlington.
    ""Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
Jim Ammeen,"" Nathan said.
    An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge
said he would not rule on the request today.

16278,COOPERVISION &lt;EYE> FORMS RECAPITALIZATION PLAN,"Coopervision Inc said it is
preparing a recapitalization plan, which includes a common
stock repurchase program and an exchange of debt securities for
common stock.
    The plan, along with a proposal to change its name to
Cooper Cos Inc, will be submitted for shareholders' approval at
the company's annual meeting on June 22.
    The meeting had been postponed from its original date of
May 14 in order to let management review recapitalization
options, it said.
    In addition, Coopervision said operating income in its
current fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show an
improvement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs and
its year ago quarter.
    Income from continuing operations was not immediately
availalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which it
reported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs.
    At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference,
Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previously
announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for
shareholders.
    He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its
second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35
dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of his
position.
    ""The stock dropped six dlrs in three days after Boesky sold
his position and has never recovered,"" Montgomery said. The
company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.
    Montgomery further told the conference, ""Don't be an
investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery
in operating or net income in 1987 and 1988.""
    ""Our concentration is on maintaining or increasing market
share in our core businesses this year and next, regardless of
the impact to the bottom line,"" he said.

    ""The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly
improved earnings this year,"" Burnell Roberts, chairman and
chief executive officer said.
    Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
    In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing
operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
    Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
conditions and improved operations.

9490,TALKING POINT/TOBACCO STOCKS,"Stocks of tobacco companies rose
sharply as investors grew more confident that an excise tax
would not be imposed on tobacco, traders and analysts said.
    They also said the stocks are relatively inexpensive since
fear of the tax and of pending litigation regarding warning
labels for tobacco products have kept many investors away
recently.
    Philip Morris Cos &lt;MO> rose 2-5/8 to 87-3/4, RJR Nabisco
&lt;RJR> 1-1/4 to 57-1/2 and U.S. Tobacco &lt;UBO> 7/8 to 27.
    ""The near-term activity of these stocks has been dominated
by external factors such as smoking restriction legislation,
concern over liability suits and the possible imposition of
excise taxes,"" Dean Witter analyst Lawrence Adelman said. ""But
the feeling is that many of those externals have been
discounted in the price of the stocks.""
    Adelman, who issued a positive recommendation on Philip
Morris earlier this week, said there have been indications that
the Reagan Administration's staunch opposition to tax hikes
would short-circuit attempts to tax tobacco.
    ""The tobaccos do have more risks than regular consumer
stocks because of these external factors,"" Adelman said. ""They
are not for the weak-hearted, but they offer a lot of value for
the aggressive investor.""
    In a market where everyone is looking for affordable
stocks, trader Drew Schaefer of Kidder Peabody said, it is not
hard to understand why the tobaccos, which have been depressed
for a while in a positive market, are attracting buyers.
    Adelman believes one of the better buys is Philip Morris.
""It is a powerhouse of potential growth in earnings, dividends
and free cash flow. And the stock is cheap now,"" he said.
    Adelman expects Morris to earn eight dlrs a share this year
compared to 6.20 dlrs a share earned a year ago. In 1988, the
company should report a profit 10.30 dlrs a share.

4477,TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP &lt;PCC>,"Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on
specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would
find a new suitor for the company, traders said.
    Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265
mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of
its Purolator courier division's management.
    The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.
    Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned
from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.
    The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because
the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from
soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a
better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be
found if the company would agree to be sold to some other
entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier
division.
    ""Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has
450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's
being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,"" said Gardner in a telephone
interview with Reuters.
    Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm
associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity
companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he
personally owns 20,000 shares.
    A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the
letter from Gardner.
    Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service
may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the
transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also
speculated another courier company would be the most likely
suitor.
    While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no
new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed
the stock into play again.
    ""There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question
of management's willingness to let the process continue,"" said
one arbitrager.
    Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they
believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.
Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs
cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought
for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.
courier operations.
    The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that
Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and
will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in
Purolator.
    ""As far as I can tell from the public documents from the
deal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.
One always likes a situation like that. You always like to
think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be
someone else in the world that could do it higher,"" said one
arbitrager.
    The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and
sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the
firm will not end up paying for its equity position.
    While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document
did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to
keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some
risk to the firm.
    ""There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,
and all sorts of things that make it very speculative,"" said
one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to
employees.
    The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs
in so-called ""bridge"" financing for the transaction. The bridge
financing is a temporary loan from Hutton.
    The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,
expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to
replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could
be a substantial expense to the firm.
    Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln
dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction
said fees are at the low end of the scale.
    ""It's a very complex transaction, but basically what
happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture
any investment they might have once the merger takes place,""
Gardner said.

5978,U.S. TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS BANK LOANS TOO SLOW,"Treasury Secretary James Baker,
while defending the progress of his 1985 debt initiative,
conceded that lending by commercial banks to developing
countries has not gone as fast as the administration would have
liked.
    In testimony before a House Appropriations subcommittee,
Baker said, however, ""I think it is wrong to say that
(commercial bank lending) has not occured in a meaningful way.""
    He added though that it has not ""materialized as fast as we
would have liked.""
    The Treasury secretary also said that it would be
politically wrong for the United States or other countries to
guarantee loans made by commercial banks to the developing
country debtors because that would be ""rightly perceived as a
bank bailout.""
    Baker also said that it would be impractical for
governments to mandate bank lending to the third world since
this would have the eventual impact of turning commercial banks
away from making all loans to the region.

237,INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE,"Indonesia appears to be nearing a
political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected
economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.
    To counter falling oil revenues, the government has
launched a series of measures over the past nine months to
boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new
investment.
    Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading
primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year""s
fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its
currency by 31 pct in September.
    But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto""s
government appears to be divided over what direction to lead
the economy.
    ""(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to
deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,""
the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia""s agricultural
sector, but also reviews the country""s general economic
performance.
    It says that while many government officials and advisers
are recommending further relaxation, ""there are equally strong
pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.""
    ""This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,""
the report says.
    Indonesia""s economic changes have been welcomed by the World
Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,
though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and
steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.
    Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,
which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade
restrictions and liberalised imports.
    The report says Indonesia""s economic growth in calendar 1986
was probably about zero, and the economy may even have
contracted a bit. ""This is the lowest rate of growth since the
mid-1960s,"" the report notes.
    Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a
population of 168 million, is facing general elections in
April.
    But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement
in the economic outlook. ""For 1987 early indications point to a
slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic
activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export
earnings from the petroleum industry.""
    ""Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak
domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real
declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of
growth in agriculture,"" the report states.
    Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is
crucial for the government to get the international lending its
needs.
    A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance
of payments support was given partly to help the government
maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.

273,SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD,"Saudi crude oil output last month fell
to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd
in January, Gulf oil sources said.
    They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah
terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month
from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some
customers.
    But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf
exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd
from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.
    The production figures include neutral zone output but not
sales from floating storage, which are generally considered
part of a country's output for Opec purposes.
    Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a
production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group
last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs
a barrel.
    The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week
appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February
entitlements before the month-end.
    Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued
support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude
customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.
    The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc
&lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement
last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.
    However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's
ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will
come this month, when demand for petroleum products
traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent
weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.
    Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday
reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord
and said it would never sell below official prices.
    The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell
slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in
January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export
refineries.
    They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd
last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at
Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady
at around 200,000 bpd each.

4,TALKING POINT/BANKAMERICA &lt;BAC> EQUITY OFFER,"BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    ""The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,""
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    ""I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could,"" said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

    But the company stressed in a filing with the Securities

15939,U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL,"The United States' dependency on
foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Associates.
    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
level of 47 pct in 1977.
    ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
inevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
40 pct by 1990.
    ""However, the rate of this growth can be affected
positively or negatively through government action or
inaction,"" Lichtblau said.
    He said that one of the government's negative actions is
the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
flow for oil exploration.
    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
    ""An international floor price adopted by all or most
industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
we imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.
    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
for alternative energy.

1152,ROYAL BANK/CANADA SEES HIGHER 1987 LOAN LOSSES,"&lt;Royal Bank of Canada> said it
estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr
increase over last year.
    Royal Bank said it set its provisions ""given the continued
debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy
industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices,"" and also
continued to add to its general provisions for loans to
troubled borrower countries.
    The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended
January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the
year-ago quarter.
    The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan
losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0
billion dlrs a year ago.
    In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan
Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans
associated with the energy sector--continue to have a
substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.
    Taylor said profitability of the bank's international
operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related
difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and
unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.
    Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the
outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their
potential impact on the Royal Bank.
    The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to
114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago.

937,U.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY,"Britain's gold and currency reserves
showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a
72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.
    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England
operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of
borrowings and repayments.
    This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.
    The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity
of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn
and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.
    Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26
billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.
    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were
36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while
repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a
Treasury spokesman said.
    Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January,
capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation
change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the
quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
swap.
    The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's
market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank
of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound
today.
    A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures,
said that the government does not want sterling either to rise
too far or to fall substantially from current levels.
    He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.

could make all of its scheduled montly debt service payments
for 1987 despite the falloff in its rental operations, but
making the payments would probably severely impair its
liquidity and restrict its ability to maintain the quality of
its properties.
    The company today reported a 1986 loss of 1,544,000 dlrs
compared with a 1985 profit of 3,912,000 dlrs.
    Southwest said in addition to its monthly scheduyled debt
service payments, a 1,743,000 dlr loan on one of its Houston
properties is due to mature on April One.
    Southwest said a commitment to reduce the interest rate and
extend the Houston loan for one year has been accepted.
    It said talks are underway with lenders on other Houston
properties to obtain partial debt service moratoriums which, if
granted, would cut 1987 cash deficits from 1986 levels.  The
loan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or other
litigation connected with the specific properties involved and
could involve the suspension of interest and principal payments
to some of the lenders.  Southwest said if the attempts to
restructure debt do not succeed, it could lose one or more of
the properties.
    Southwest said the Houston properties made up about 10 pct
of its current value equity as of December 31 of 14.20 dlrs per
share, down from 16.68 dlrs a year before.
    The company said depending on the success of the talks and
operating results for 1987, one or two more properties could
become subject to similar negotiations.  The two additional
properties comprised about 11 pct of its current value equity
at year-end, Southwest said.

8107,PREMIER SAYS YUGOSLAVIA WILL PAY ITS DEBTS,"Yugoslavia, whose economic crisis is
under close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not follow
Brazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt,
Prime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying.
    Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in an
interview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency.
    He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and would
continue to do so, but he said creditors and international
institutions should show more ""understanding"" for Yugoslavia's
situation.
    Mikulic said Yugoslavia had ""understanding"" for what Brazil
had done.
    Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, lagging
exports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposed
partial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread
strikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the army
could be called in if Yugoslavia's political system was
threatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 with
hard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid a
record 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing its
overall debt by 996 mln dlrs.
    Government ministers told reporters last week they
regretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said the
cost to the economy had been too great.
    Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos
Milosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. Foreign
Minister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, ""radical changes"" in
interest rates and repayment times were needed.
    Western economists said Mikulic's remarks, taken with those
of his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seen
ahead in financing the debt repayments.
    Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be considered
by the Paris club at the end of this month.
    The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewed
the Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to be
alarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here
and the possibility of balance of payments problems later this
year.
    Mikulic visits West Germany next week, and debt is expected
to figure high on the agenda of his talks with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.

10138,FARM CREDIT AID SEEN BROADENED TO OTHER LENDERS,"Farm-state Senators indicated they
may broaden a Farm Credit System rescue package to include aid
for borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks, as
well as the farm credit system.
    Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture subcommittee responsible for farm credit, said
legislation to rescue the financially-troubled system should
provide help to borrowers from all lenders to agriculture.
    ""We must provide some form of interest rate buydown,
principal reduction relief for all eligible farmers and
ranchers regardless of their lending institution,"" Boren said.
    Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen.
James McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package should
cover all lenders to agriculture.
    The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsements
for the across-the-board approach from the nation's largest
farm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and
from the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden the
focus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system.
Until now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on how
to resurrect the failing system.
    Boren said borrowers from private lenders such as
commercial banks and life insurance companies must be included
in the aid package because ""it would not be fair to address
only the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers.""
    However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-board
interest rate or principal buydown did not say how much the
broad approcah would cost.
    But Neil Harl, professor of economics at Iowa State
University told the hearing the cost could be in the range of
3.5 billion dlrs annually.

12909,ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EFTA FEARS EC MARKET PLANS,"The European Community wants to eliminate
all obstacles to free movement of goods, services and people by
1992, a laudable goal that has sent shivers down the spines of
its closest trading neighbours.
    Europe's outsiders -- the six members of the European Free
Trade Association (EFTA), and other small states -- fear the
growing power of the 12 EC member countries, a market of 320
mln people, one and a half times as big as the whole U.S.
    And as the Community celebrates its 30th anniversary, in
non-EC countries from Ankara to Oslo, an attitude is emerging
which says, ""If you can't beat them, join them.""
    In June 1985, the Community adopted a plan to create an
""internal market"" without restrictions, which included new goals
on everything from tourism to the rules of bank accounting.
    The plan is so extensive that even the EFTA countries --
Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland --
with decades of close trade ties, find it hard to adopt a joint
position.
    Last month Turkey formally requested EC membership,
receiving a polite reply from Brussels that the time was not
ripe.
    In Austria, where its 1955 charter of neutrality forbids
joining political alliances, the government is looking for ways
to become a ""de facto"" EC member.
    And in Norway, where membership was rejected in a 1972
referendum, government officials are wondering whether the
political climate has changed.
    But nowhere has the debate been more existential than in
Switzerland, which has resisted all alliances for 700 years.
    The Swiss are a microcosm of Europe, living geographically
in the very heart of Europe and speaking the languages of the
three big economies -- Germany, France and Italy.
    Swiss neutrality, which has kept the country out of the
United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, would seem
to preclude membership in the Community, given the EC's loose
link with the Western defence alliance NATO.
    But an opinion poll late last year, held in the
French-speaking part of the country, showed a majority favoured
joining the Community.
    Since then, government officials have stressed that, while
membership was impossible, Switzerland should do everything
possible not to be locked out when the trade barriers inside
the EC come down.
    State secretary for foreign trade Franz Blankart, said it
is inconceivable the whole Swiss nation -- including the more
conservative German-speaking majority -- would vote for
membership.
    But Switzerland must be more than just a ""satellite,"" he
said, now that the enlarged Community is extending itself into
areas omitted by the founding Treaty of Rome.
    These areas, including pharmaceutical research and
technological development, are the key to the economic future
of Switzerland and the Community alike, he adds.
    ""We cannot permit ourselves the luxury of passively
following the Community's new dynamic of integration,"" he says.
    The Swiss economy ministry has drawn up a detailed analysis
of the EC White Paper on the internal market, outlining the
Swiss response to each point. While some refer to a collective
EFTA stance, officials admit that on many issues Switzerland
may have act alone.
    The new EC plans on transport, for example, would have a
severe impact on Switzerland and Austria, whose roads carry
most of the traffic between Italy and its EC partners.
    But rules such as the volume of petrol buses are allowed to
carry across a border have much less importance to Sweden or
Finland.
    Switzerland wants to work out ways to help people crossing
its borders with West Germany, France and Italy. But it is
afraid the liberal border controls Denmark, an EC member, has
with the non-EC Nordic countries might pose a threat to
security.
   And pin the fields of banking and insurance -- the very
lifeblood of Switzerland's service sector -- Swiss interests
could prove directly opposite to its EFTA partners with their
pppppppnarrow and tightly protected financial markets.
    The biggest danger ahead, EFTA members have said, would be
that their divided interests might leave the EC free to set
whatever guidelines and standards it wanted and force them on
other European states that wanted to trade.

8601,SUPERCONDUCTOR RESEARCH MAY BOOST TOKYO STOCKS,"Research into materials that conduct
electricity with minimal resistance could lead to further gains
on Tokyo's booming stock market, brokers said.
    They said the share prices of companies likely to benefit
from the so-called 'superconductors' rose sharply last week
after publication of articles about the research in the
economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun. The companies were in the
non-ferrous metal, electrical and mining sectors.
    But industry analysts said development problems remain and
commercial application is still some years away.
    ""The area clearly has significant applications but it won't
be commercially viable for a few years,"" said Thomas Murtha,
technology analyst with James Capel and Co.
    Industry analysts said the use of superconductors could
bring sharp cuts in electricity costs if present problems can
be overcome.
    Nikko Securities Co Ltd analyst Shinichi Nakayama said
superconductors could have applications in computer circuitry,
electricity generation and storage, and scientific research.
    The superconductors are made of a blend of metals fused in
a heat-firing process similar to that used in ceramics.
    Nakayama said Kawasaki Steel Corp &lt;KAWS.T> predicted in an
in-house study that by 1990 the worldwide market would be worth
150 billion yen for superconductors used in computers, 50
billion for those used in electricity generators and 150
billion for those used in electricity storage.
    The study said that by 1995 there would be trains capable
of 500 km an hour, hovering on a magnetic field and powered
mainly by superconductors. One hundred billion yen worth of
superconducting material would be needed for such a train.
    The Kawasaki study also said superconductors would be used
in nuclear fusion physics, but not until the year 2000.
    Industry analysts said superconductors have no commercial
applications at present. In laboratory tests the conductor must
be cooled by expensive liquid helium or hydrogen before minimum
electrical resistance is achieved, though liquid nitrogen,
which is much less expensive, has recently also been used
successfully, they said.
    Despite this, investors on Tokyo's stock market have
boosted shares of firms related to superconducting materials.
    From the close of trading on March 17 until yesterday's
close, Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Co Ltd's &lt;MIMI.T> share
price rose 140 yen to 485 yen.
    In the same period Mitsubishi Metal Corp &lt;MITM.T>, rose 95
to 745 yen, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd &lt;TOMM.T> rose 200 to

    Furukawa Electric Co Ltd shares &lt;URUT.T> jumped 104 yen to
689 yen, and Fuji Electric Co Ltd &lt;FUJE.T> rose 141 to 619.
    Brokers said shares of suppliers of scientific instruments
needed to conduct the superconductor research also rose.
    Industry analysts said the most favoured superconductor,
made from a blend of yttrium, barium and copper, is currently
undergoing laboratory tests under a scheme coordinated by the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).

4098,BRITISH TELECOM SEES SATISFACTORY 1986/87 RESULTS,"British Telecommunications Plc &lt;BTY.L>
expects to announce satisfactory results for its 1986/87
financial year ending March, chairman Sir George Jefferson said
in a third quarter statement.
    Full year results will be published in June. In the 1985/86
financial year, pre-tax profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from
1.48 billion in the previous period.
    Jefferson said good progress was made in the latest nine
months, while most customers were able to maintain their normal
level of calls during the recent strike by company engineers.
    The statement said a positive cash flow of 381 mln stg for
the first nine months will diminish in the final quarter due to
corporation tax and dividend payments.
    Earlier, the company reported third quarter pre-tax profit
for the period ended December 31 of 506 mln stg compared with
452 mln a year earlier. Nine month pre-tax was 1.51 billion stg
against 1.35 billion.
    British Telecom shares were last quoted at 246-1/2p, level
with late yesterday, in the wake of results which were in line
with market expectations, dealers said.

sanctions, despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for
Washington today.
    Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of State for Political

persuade the U.S. Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports
said, and replied: ""...It is probably too early for the figures

    Armacost said the U.S. Hopes Japan will take steps to lift
its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports, remove
barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues.
    ""There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area,
but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from
important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on

to do their best to increase imports, ministry officials said.
    The meeting was unveiled as part of a plan to boost imports
and help head off protectionist legislation in the U.S.
    Senior officials from the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry told reporters that such personal appeals appeared
to have paid off in the past, as Japanese imports of
manufactured goods have climbed.
    Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports
and cut production of key memory microchips next month in an
attempt to help ward off U.S. Trade sanctions, company
spokesmen said.
    The officials also said they expect the government's new
trade insurance law to boost imports and encourage Japanese
companies to set up production facilities overseas.
    Under the new law, the government will insure Japanese
companies who pre-pay for imports against loss arising from
everything from war to bankruptcy of the foreign firm they are

quiet trading after early indications suggested a positive move
forward on the back of the latest opinion polls and record
closing highs on the Tokyo and Wall Street stock exchanges. At
0815 GMT the FTSE 100 index was 4.7 off at 1984.5.
    Dealers said the effect of news today of two opinion polls,
one of which, conducted for the television programme TV-AM,
placing the Conservative party 13 points ahead of the
Opposition Labour Party was offset by a belief that the
market's gains yesterday may have been overdone and that a
period of consolidation is due.
    An opinion poll published in the Times newspaper today
which measured party support in marginal seats gave the ruling
Conservative Party a lead of six points over the Labour Party.
    Operators said although the market is generally convinced
the Conservatives will win the next general election,
uncertainty over the date is continuing to provide an
unsettling influence.

    Dealers also said fears of a trade war with Japan, although
less acute, remain a nagging concern in the absence of fresh

    Unilever gained 10p to 2,560, Dixons 4p to 373, British

    Banks were mostly lower but showed modest declines.
Barclays eased a penny to 503, as did Natwest at 588.
    Standard Chartered lost 3p to 821 after recent gains on bid
speculation. Press reports said Australian businessman Robert
Holmes A'Court increased his stake in the company yesterday.
Dealers said Lloyds bank is widely expected to renew its offer
for Standard once its one-year bid limit ends in July. Lloyds
rose one penny to 488.
    Government bonds showed gains ranging to 3/16 point, mostly

Corporation.
    The company also said it will postpone planned second
quarter sales of up to one billion dlrs of adjustable rate
mortgage-backed securities because secondary market premiums
have temporarily contracted.
   
    It said the write-off will reduce net earnings for the
quarter and year by about 13 cents per share and the
postponement of securities sales will defer about 30 cts per
share of profits to subsequent quarters.
    The company said the write-off of the FSLIC asset was

declared the FSLIC technically insolvent.
    The company said it also received a letter from the FSLIC
informing Ahmanson that it will not honor its long-standing

    The company blamed the expected loss on regulatory and

hazardous waste treatment cites in Califoirnia, continued
startup delays for major remediation projects, the writeoff of
an investment in a subsidiary and a settlem,ent with the
California Attorney General's Office and Department of Health
Services.
    The company said the settlement relates to regulatory
violations alleged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agengy
and the California Health Services department at the company's
Vine Hill and Panoche treatment facilities in Northern
California.
    It said under the agreement, it will pay the state
2,100,000 dlrs in civil penalties over a two-year period and
pay 500,000 dlrs over five years to local medical facilities as
part of a community awareness and emergency response program
developed by local communities.  The expenses will be charged

    The company said it has agreed as well to make compliance

Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cable
and Wireless Plc's &lt;CAWL.L> shareholding in a new Japanese
telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in
trade relations.
    In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications
ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way
Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade
imbalance between the two countries.
    ""I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that
I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt
deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which
would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world,""
Howard told reporters.
    ""He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the
message got home,"" he added.
    British frustration over the lopsided trade balance -
nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has
reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue, Howard
said.
    Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and
Wireless from having a major role in the international
telephone market in Japan.
    ""I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I
want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading
relations,"" Howard said. ""We simply aren't prepared to continue
to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a
long time.""
    Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable
to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister.
    But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister
Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are
increasing, but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade.
    Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications
dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.
    Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering
possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the
telecommunications issue.
    ""There are measures which are under consideration if we
continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,""
he added, but gave no details.
    He said he had received a reassuring response from the
Japanese he has spoken with.
    ""But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese
for quite some time,"" he added. ""What I've made plain is we
expect to see action.""
    Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial
Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices.
Those powers, which allow London to ban foreign financial firms
like banks from Britain, are designed to ensure U.K. Firms
equal access to overseas financial markets.

1968,HONG KONG CD MARKET SHUTS DOWN AFTER NEW ISSUE,"The Hong Kong dollar fixed rate market
was shut down this afternoon after a 200 mln H.K. Dlr
certificate of deposit issue for the Chinese state-owned Bank
of Communications Ltd Hong Kong branch suddenly surfaced,
bankers said.
    Disgruntled dealers said the market was slowly on the road
to recovery after a bout of sell-off that began in early
February but it was still too fragile to absorb a new issue.
    Brokers said the new deal took them by surprise and all
major players stopped making markets in existing issues.
    The fixed rate market, which consists mainly of CDs tied to
swaps or asset repackaging, began to fall about a month ago due
to indigestion after 18 CD issues totalling 2.3 billion dlrs
flooded the market in January.
    Bankers said the shake-up was a result of participants
pushing the market up too fast in January amid intense
speculation that the Hong Kong dollar's 7.80 peg rate against
the U.S. Dollar would soon be changed.
    The speculation depressed local interest rates and
unleashed a flood of new issues.
    But the speculation faded in early February and interest
rates climbed as the government remained adamant in maintaining
the peg, thus triggering an adjustment on the fixed rate
capital market.
    By late February the market had recovered considerably but
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York
launched their issues and pushed the market down again. Since
then there has been no new issues for nearly two weeks until
China Development Finance Co (H.K.) Ltd (CDFC), a unit of the
Bank of China, launched the five-year deal at 7.05 pct with
quarterly interest payment in mid-afternoon today.
    Brokers said the market was steady early this morning but
began to slip marginally by late morning as rumours of a new
issue circulated.
    When the deal was launched the major players quickly
suspended trading and refused to quote prices for their own
issues, brokers said. ""We just don't know where the market is
going,"" said a European banker.
    They said the Bank of Communications issue traded at a low
of 99.70 but was later pushed up to 99.90/95, within the 10
basis point fee, adding that buying came mainly from sister
banks in the Bank of China group.
    An official with one of the Chinese banks said the deal was
launched at an effective yield of 7.26 pct, in line with the
market at that time.
    But a European banker said pricing was not an issue IN the
present market conditionS, ""the timing was just not right.""
    ""If banks had more patience they wouldn't launch any issues
now, and then the market would be all right,"" another dealer
said.
    ""But there is no reason to be overly pessimistic,"" he said.
""The effect of this issue on the market should not be as bad as
what happened after the DKB and Morgan deals.""
    Despite the criticism bankers said CDFC still managed to
recruit more than 10 underwriters though the composition of the
group has not yet been finalised.
    ""Any trader should recommend his bank against joining the
deal,"" said a dealer. ""But there are other considerations such as
relationship."" He admitted his bank has joined as co-manager.
    A banker said he saw no reason why the market makers
decided to shut down if they were willing to join the new
issue.
    ""Perhaps they were jealous that for the first time a Chinese
entity has taken the sole lead position for a Chinese issue,"" he
said.
    Previously Chinese entities have always acted as co-lead
managers, whether for Chinese or foreign issues.

17050,JAPAN AGENCY URGES WATCH ON YEN RISE EFFECTS,"Japan should look out for possible
effects of the yen's recent sharp rise on Japan's economy as
growth remains slow, the government's Economic Planning Agency
said in a monthly report submitted to cabinet ministers.
    EPA officials told reporters the underlying trend of the
economy is firm but growth is slow due to sluggish exports.
    Customs-cleared exports by volume fell 4.9 pct
month-on-month in February after a 2.8 pct fall in March.
    The government must take adequate economic measures to
expand domestic demand and stabilise exchange rates in a bid to
ensure sustained econonic growth, the report said.
    The report made a special reference to the yen's renewed
rise and its effect on the economy, the officials said, adding
the agency's judgement of current economic conditions has not
changed since last month.
    The EPA said last month Japan's economy is beginning to
show signs of bottoming out, conditional upon exchange rates.
    The dollar fell below 139 yen in early trading today - a

4407,"BRITANNIA"" COIN TO SELL AT PREMIUM","The new British one ounce gold coin, the
""Britannia,"" will be priced on the basis of the gold price on the
day of purchase plus a ""competitive premium,"" Treasury officials
said.
    Value added tax will be levied on all purchases by members
of the U.K. Public, as is currently the case with foreign
coins, although transactions between members of the London Gold
Market and all exports of the coins will be zero-rated. No
decision has yet been taken on the face value of the coins.
    Although a number of gold coins, especially the Canadian
Maple, have been issued elsewhere in an attempt to take the
place of the South African krugerrand, the British government
still feels that there is a gap in the market for a British one
ounce gold coin. The only British gold coin available at
present is the sovereign, which contains 0.2354 ounces of gold.
    Gold from South Africa or the Soviet Union will not be used
in the coin, officials said, adding that bullion would be
bought on the world gold market. But analysts said it would be
difficult to ascertain the origins of such purchases.
    No details are yet available on how many coins will be
issued or how much gold will be bought, but traders said that
the amounts involved would be unlikely to move the gold price.
    There were some enquiries on the ""Britannia"" from coin
dealers today, but value added tax would prove a major factor
in the success of the coin, with the 15 pct tax likely to put
off many investors, traders said.
    Some said that the ""Britannia"" had come too late, with the
Canadian Maple Leaf, the American Eagle and other gold coins
already well established.

17419,NIPPON MINING PLANS MORE U.S. JOINT VENTURES,"Nippon Mining Co Ltd president Yukio
Kasahara said the state-owned Japanese firm hoped to find
additional joint venture partners to explore for U.S. oil
reserves.
    ""We have to secure the stability of oil for Japan,""
Kasahara told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress. ""In
the exploration area I think Japanese companies are interested
in joint ventures.""
    Nippon Mining, for example, last September signed an
agreement with Dupont Co's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc to participate in a
135 mln dlr exploration venture that includes six wells on land
and 14 offshore Louisiana. The first joint well drilled is in
the Gulf of Mexico's Green Canyon Block 182, a deepwater lease
that Conoco was almost forced to return to the federal
government undrilled because of low oil prices.
    ""At this moment we have no success but we will proceed with
Conoco. Maybe by the end of the year we will find oil there,""
Kasahara said. He said that similar kinds of joint ventures
""would be best"" for Nippon Mining's oil exploration efforts in
the future.
    Kasahara also said Nippon Mining was not planning to
acquire any U.S. refining or marketing outlets. ""Retail sales
in general do not interest the Japanese oil companies,"" he
said.
    When asked whether he believed world oil prices might
strengthen later this year, Kasahara said he expected prices to
hold steady at today's level.
    ""Within this year I think the 18 dlrs a barrel will
continue. But next year I don't know,"" he said. ""For the
refining business, stability is important. Whether the price is
18 dlrs or 20 dlrs, we don't care.""
    But encouraging additional upstream efforts may require
modestly higher oil prices, Kasahara added. ""For exploration I
think 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would be
reasonable,"" he said.
    The key factor in determining whether the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr a
barrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran and
Iraq, Kasahara said. Saudi Arabia, he added, was an uncertain
element in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintain
revenues at the same time the weakened U.S. dollar has reduced
oil profits.
    Nippon Mining, which like all Japanese crude buyers is
benefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar, favors
continuing to price OPEC crude oil according to U.S. currency
regardless of the dollar-yen relationship, Kasahara said.
    ""I hope the dollar would strengthen eventually and continue
to improve. I would prefer to see the (OPEC) pricing remain in
dollars,"" he said.

&lt;RGFJ.S> (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open
for an extra five years following a new aid package from the
state government, RGC said in a statement.
    The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40
series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the
deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.
    The Australian dollar's fall since 1985 also improved the
local dollar copper price, making the company profitable and
justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of
about 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said.
    Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep
contained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000
tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln
dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said.
    The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a
major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast
of Tasmania.
    The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10
mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr
advance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions
and deferred royalties and payroll taxes.

5895,EC WARNS U.S. AND JAPAN ON TRADE TENSIONS,"The European Community (EC) yesterday
warned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners,
that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relations
with both countries.
    EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's
continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make
a greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they
were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that
would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were
prepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already
distanced itself from the bill.
    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written
to his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
outlining the EC's concerns.
    The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S.
Moves towards protectionism. ""The adoption of such measures
would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of
multilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral
relations,"" it said.
    Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but
to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, it said.
    In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said
they ""deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in
trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more.""
    The statement said the EC would continue to insist that
Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand.
    Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a
report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them
to take appropriate action where necessary.
    One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers
were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. ""It will
be back on the table again and again,"" the diplomat said.
    De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said,
""There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the
Community concerning trade relations with Japan.""
    But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo
to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and
damaging trade war, and the ministers called for more
cooperation with Japan in industry and research.

9163,SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT TO STOP IMPORTING SUGAR,"The Food Department will no longer
import sugar from April 1, senior officials of the Food and
Cooperatives Ministry and the Department told Reuters.
    They said the decision was taken after the Sugar Importers
Association asked that the sugar trade be further liberalised.
    ""The Food Department will cease trading in sugar and will no
longer hold a buffer stock,"" a senior official said.
    He said the government has finalised an agreement with
E.D.F.Man (Sugar) Ltd under which E.D.F.Man will hold a buffer
stock on the government's behalf of 20,000 tonnes, against the
45,000 tonne buffer stock usually held by the Department.
    Officials said the size of the buffer stock has been
reduced because the private sector will hold its own stocks.
    The agreement with E.D.F. Man includes details such as
trigger pricing mechanisms, they said.
    Four months ago the Department allowed the private sector
to import sugar without government clearance. The Department
and the private sector each imported around 115,000 tonnes of
sugar last year, when national consumption was 280,000 tonnes.
    An Importers Association official said that ""even if the
Department no longer imports sugar, we would not necessarily
buy more.""
    This is because the Association would still have to compete
with the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE), he said.
    The CWE is a semi-government body and the official said
arrangements are being made for state cooperatives and holders
of food subsidy stamps to draw their sugar from it, starting
April 1.
    Ministry officials said the CWE can either import sugar or
buy it from a local bonded warehousing scheme run by E.D.F. For
the past two years.

11243,MANNESMANN SEES DIFFICULT YEAR FOR CAPITAL GOODS,"Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> expects a
difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief
executive Werner Dieter told a news conference.
    Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in
foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher
mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer
nations.
    Domestic business was also declining and orders for West
German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,
Dieter said.
    Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.
    Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a
set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started
last year, were now having an effect.
    Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products
accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The
company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter
said had become one of Mannesmann's ""strategic aims.""
    He said the company's drive to combine activities in
mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular ""plus
point"" for Mannesmann.
    Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take
a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group
for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall
nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net
profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.
    It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar
and lack of demand for steel pipe.

were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added
the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this

charged the United States with breaking international trade
rules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market and
said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT.
    In the latest of a series of trade disputes with
Washington, the executive authority alleged that a section of
the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT (General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) because it discriminated
against imported products in favour of domestically-produced
goods.
    The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule
on whether the section in question, which officials said had
proved a barrier to many EC exporters, conformed to its rules.
    Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures
if, after a GATT decision against it, Washington failed to
bring the disputed section into line with international rules.
    The executive's decision to go to GATT follows a complaint
to it by the Dutch company Akzo &lt;AKZO.AS>, whose ""aramid""
synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because
of charges by the U.S. Firm &lt;Dupont> that the fibres violate
the American company's patents.
    Akzo alleged that the ban, imposed by the U.S.
International Trade Commission (ITC), was discriminatory and
incompatible with GATT provisions.
    The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the
U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction  over imported
products. The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not
have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the
ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court.
    ""Consequently the procedure followed...Is less favourable
than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods
produced in the United States,"" it said in a statement.

    Presidents Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and Denis Sassou-
Nguesso of Congo urged Africa's development partners to act
over the continent's debt, which now totals 175 billion dlrs,
at a meeting organised by the Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA).
    Their view was backed by Monique Landry, Canada's Minister
for External Relations. ""Whether we look at aid or debt or
trade, the rich countries have not as yet lived up to their
part of last year's economic recovery pact.""
    Babangida said it was unrealistic to expect any country to
spend more than 30 pct of its earnings on debt servicing
particularly as prices for the continent's commodities were so
unstable.
    Sassou Nguesso, current Chairman of the Organisation of
African Unity, accused international aid donors of failing to
provide the vigorous effort they promised a year ago.
    The conference, attended by African ministers, economists
and representatives from major donors, will review progress
since both sides agreed at the U.N. Last year to revive the
African economy over five years.
    The response from the international community has been
negative and projections of improved growth rates for Africa
already look far too optimistic, ECA Executive Secretary
Adebayo Adedeji told the conference.

Africa's poorest countries to be written off and for repayment
and grace terms to be eased.

plans to introduce electronic trading of shares listed on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
System (NASDAQ) in the U.S. And on London's Stock Exchange
Automated Quotation System, banking sources said.
    The SES is discussing the idea with the London and New York
authorities. Gordon Macklin, president of the National
Association of Securities Dealers in Washington, said he was
very optimistic about an early agreement, possibly by the end
of this month.
    Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) sources told Reuters
they supported the proposed linking of computer trading systems
on the three exchanges, and the banking sources said local
financial support for the plan existed.
    Macklin said if an agreement were reached it would move the
three exchanges towards 24-hour trading, with Singapore filling
a gap when no trading takes place.
    A small group of selected stocks would be used at the start
of three-centre trading to determine investor interest.
    The Singapore, London and New York authorities have agreed
in principle on how the three exchanges would trade and
transfer information among the different time zones, but some
details still have to be worked out, a senior Singapore bank
director said.
    Questions remain concerning investor willingness to deploy
sufficient capital in Singapore to ensure adequate market
liquidity and communication links to the other three centres.
    But if agreement is reached, Singapore will have a head
start over the other Asian financial centres in Hong Kong,
Toyko and Australia, he said.
    On February 18 the SES created the Stock Exchange of
Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ),
modelled on NASDAQ.
    At present SESDAQ is trading the shares of only one
company, the government-owned Singapore National Printers Ltd
(SNP), but its turnover has been fairly active, and other small
firms have said they plan to seek listings soon.
    Market sources expect the next few companies listed will
also be government-owned entities, which would have no problem
meeting the listing conditions. Approval for a listing of
Trans-Island Bus Service Pte Ltd is expected soon, they said.
    SNP, previously wholly-owned by the government's Temasek
Holdings (Pte) Ltd, issued seven mln 50-cent shares at one dlr
each last month in a public offering oversubscribed 119 times.
    In SESDAQ trading, SNP shares have advanced from an initial

10344,ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH EXCHANGE RATE POLICY,"Recent slackness on Dutch capital
markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank's
policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark
and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.
    While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend the
guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use
of the range within which the guilder and the mark can
fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System
(EMS).
    Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV
(Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious.
    ""I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the
range given to the guilder in the EMS,"" Nelissen said at the
presentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week.
    Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against
the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.
    The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to
keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a
stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate
policies to influence the exchange rate.
    The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate
aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.
    Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.
    Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: ""By
maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the
expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it
suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to
obtain.""
    Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest
rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of
securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital
market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring
about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he
added.
    Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is
a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central
Bank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,
noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with
the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.
    ""It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference
between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,"" he added.
    Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the
Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows
between the two countries, as the economic performance of the
two does not differ much, economists said.
    Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the
Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they
accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two
countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the
Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.
    Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest
and exchange rates.
    West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single trading
partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of
imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of
Statistics figures show.
    At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits
trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a
rate of around 5-7/16 pct.
    Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will
even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in
1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.
    In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to
decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch
Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.
German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation
between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.
    But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money
dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates
independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.
    Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,
the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5
pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit
surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had
expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.
    The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact
on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.
    While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its
policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range
narrow.
    ""The European Monetary System is not only a relationship
between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the
margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell
large amounts of a third currency,"" Central Bank vice-director
Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.
    ""If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the
markets would start to believe it was weak. We don't want that.
We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the
mark,"" he said.

expected to nearly double to 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1987

    Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Last year totalled 46 mln

electronics, trading, food and service industries.
    Lee Ming-Yi, deputy director of the ministry's Industrial

19684,CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW,"U.S. moves to increase its warships in
and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on
unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.
    They said the American decision inevitably carries some
risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt
rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.
    ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the
Gulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.
    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
on ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected by
American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.
    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil
tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated
by diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that the
Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,
will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.
    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was
""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""
    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10
warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to
patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.
    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting
Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.
    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by
Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.
    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is
preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.
    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a
launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the
Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.
    ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti
territory would be a very serious escalation"" likely moving
world opinion against Iran, remarked one.
    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying
out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.
    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
last Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the event
of any U.S. strike against Iran.
    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused
of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.
    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that
most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential
trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told Reuters.
    Ongpin said the loan, carrying interest of 5.5 pct a year,
matches a 300 mln dlr economic recovery loan approved by the
World Bank in March.
    Ongpin said Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
expressed satisfaction at the recent rescheduling of the
Philippines' 10.3 billion dlr foreign debt during a meeting
here yesterday. The 14th yen aid package from Japan's Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund was also discussed.
    Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably to
a Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and
80 billion yen.
    The aid package, originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87
fiscal year ended March, was delayed because of the
Philippines' change of government last year.
    ""The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as we
are asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49
billion yen,"" he said. ""But they are likely to bring it up to
that level for the 15th package.""
    Ongpin said Manila had 14 projects in the pipeline for the
14th yen package.
    ""We are trying get the 15th package mainly in the form of
untied commodity loans,"" he said.
    Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in soft
loans to finance a land reform program, for which Japan is
expected to supply most of the financing, had been put off

    Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reform
program in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting of

8183,"DEBT SOLUTION REQUIRES OPEN MARKETS, GERMAN BANKER","The solution of the world's debt
crisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence of
protectionism is the biggest danger, the president of the
Federal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.
    Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of Dresdner
Bank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil's
suspension last month of part of its interest payments would
lead to a chain reaction in Latin America.
    It is important to increase the efficiency of debtor
countries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from
exports to repay foreign debt, he said.
    Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, but
Brazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help of
appropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring
back financial stability to that country.
    Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken
now. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able to
repay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions
improved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthen
the economic position of these countries, to ensure world
economic growth so they are able to sell their products at
adequate prices.
    Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in
coordination with governments, international organisations such
as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and
creditor banks.
    ""This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banks
alone,"" he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standing
of debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise
funds on international credit markets again. He said a whole
set of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced the
international banking system would provide more funds, but the
problem is not just economic but also political.

Canada.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration had asked for 350 mln dlrs but that Ottawa had
registered concern about the level of funding.
    He said the announcement was ""obviously related"" to an
April-5-6 summit meeting in Ottawa between Reagan and Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
    Reagan said that in addition to committing government money
industry would be encouraged to invest a greatwer or equal
amount to promote new technologies to cut air pollution.
    The announcement said an advisory panel, including state
governmments and the canadian government, would advise on
funding and selection of polllution control projects.
    Further, a presidential task force on regulatory relief
would examine the effect of federal, state and local
regulations on deployment of new emission control technologies.

Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed
combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning
of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado
due to high costs.
    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic
Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at
the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been
eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports
from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract
from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized
bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,
compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and
electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.
    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project
uneconomical even with government price supports and loan
guarantees, Unocal said.

19882,U.S. REASSERTS PLANS FOR DETERRENT ROLE IN GULF,"The United States responded to an
apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued
assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would
play purely a deterrent role.
    ""I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that
we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and
that that shipping is not related to the war itself,"" State
Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
    He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States
was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.
    Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,
""At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of
an armed encounter with us.
    ""We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.
Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We
are determined to stand firm and will certainly win.""
    The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its
Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the
refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the
strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.
    The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil
tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag
and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.
    Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, ""We won't have any comment or response to
the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about
the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war
with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements
that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not
helpful or welcome.""

group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new

3048,"ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL","The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
60 pct of government revenues.
    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
about 60 days to build.
    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
of January, about equal to one month's imports.
    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
Latin America.
    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

8630,SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL,"Leading Australian onshore oil and gas
producer, Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit
by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
    The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net
profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.
    Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement
that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along
with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil
exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal
with an adverse business climate.
    Santos said it remained financially strong with an
injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985
rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the
end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.
    It said it had also made significant progress in repaying
debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds
had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.
    Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid
for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas
company &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln
dlrs.
    Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar
denominated and significant currency purchases were made during
the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held
145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.
    Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program,
finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil
exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to
reserves -- less than depletion during the year.
    Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme
to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for
oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.
    Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and
production volumes but with extra oil exploration and
encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.
    But it called on the goverment to continue fostering
domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.
    ""It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when
exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when
Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,""
Massy-Green said.

319,INDIAN BUDGET DEFICIT SEEN FUELING INFLATION,"Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's fiscal
1987/88 budget has sparked speculation that a large deficit
will push up India's moderate inflation rate and that the
country's stock markets will experience prolonged uncertainty,
economists, politicians and stockbrokers told Reuters.
    The projected deficit for fiscal 1987/88, ending March, is
56.88 billion rupees, down from an upwardly revised estimate of
a record 82.85 billion in fiscal 1986/87.
    The projected inflation rate for fiscal 1986/87, based on
wholesale prices, is 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86.
    Economists pointed out that the government itself had
expressed concern about inflation in its most recent 1986/87
economic survey report published last week.
    Presenting the budget to parliament on Saturday, Prime
Minister Gandhi said a cabinet committee would be appointed to
trim large non-development expenditures. The deficit for
1987/88 will not be allowed to exceed the budgeted figure, he
said.
    But few analysts have taken Gandhi's assurance seriously.
They say the deficit more than doubled in 1986/87 from an
initial estimate of 36.5 billion rupees.
    Lal Krishna Advani, president of the opposition Bharatiya
Janata party, said Gandhi's failure to mention specific
measures to cut non-development expenses will push up prices.
    Economists said increased liquidity in the economy, as
reflected by expansion of the M3 aggregate money supply, may
cause prices to rise. The survey report showed the M3 rose by
15.7 pct or 185.78 billion rupees in the first nine months of
1986/87 against 13.37 pct or 136.42 billion in the same 1985/86
period.
    Economists also said uncertain monsoon rain prospects,
after bad weather last year, may strain prices further.
    Economists said the deficit would also cause the government
to rely increasingly on internal borrowing. Market loans and
bonds were projected at 981.50 billion rupees for 1987/88, up
from the 1986/87 estimate of 852.13 billion.
    No reduction has been proposed in personal income taxes,
which will discourage savings, economists said.
    Avinash Purulkar, chief manager of the state-owned Union
Bank of India, said the annual inflation rate may double to
around 15 pct in 1987/88 as the government prints more currency
notes to cover the deficit.
    Brokers said stock market investors have started selling
long-term portfolios to take advantage of a proposal in the
budget that reduces the holding period required to claim
exemption from the capital gains tax to one year from three.
    Delhi stockbroker B. D. Aggarwal said, ""There is uncertainty
in the market. There is going to be growing selling pressure.""
    But Bombay broker Dinesh Walji said the present hectic
selling of shares will slow when more buyers appear on the
scene. ""Just now there is acute nervousness in the market,"" he
said.
    Brokers said proposals to set up a mutual fund to help
small investors buy equity shares and relaxations in the
capital gains tax will inject further buoyancy into the market
on a long-term basis.
    New equity and debenture issues, both convertible and
non-convertible, rose to an officially estimated 50.70 billion
rupees in April/January 1986/87 from an estimated 36.95 billion
in all 1985/86 and 20 billion in all 1984/85.

    Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298
mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in
francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of
French debts.
    Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
(FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.
    French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last
year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct
in 1988, it added.
    Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this
year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.
    Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986,
is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODE

    However, the institute said inflation would fall back to

which will be sold to the private sector in the second half of

    The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up

    The increase in the bank's gross operating profits was

7972,EC AGREES REDUCTION OF DIESEL EXHAUST EMISSIONS,"The European Community (EC) agreed
tough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and
buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast
stretches of the region's forests.
    Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed
member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few
years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main
source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.
    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with
tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and
for all new vehicles from October 1990.
    The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of
nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year
from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all
heavy vehicles applied to the new standards.
    There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in
the EC, according to Commission figures.
    The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move
towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn
requested permission to do so to encourage the use of
low-pollution cars, diplomats said.
    West Germany will still need ministers' final approval for
such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC
environment ministers meet next on May 21.
    But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany
did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide
ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.
    Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats
said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20
mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no
damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.
    Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special
permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition
laws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement
a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol.

854,000 tonnes of sugar to European Community intervention
stocks still stands, Andrea Minguzzi, an official at French
sugar producer Beghin-Say, said.
    Last week Beghin-Say president Jean-Marc Vernes said a
possible settlement of a row with the EC would lead producers
to withdraw their offer, which was made as a protest against EC
export licensing policies.
    The EC policy is to offer export rebates, which fail to
give producers an equivalent price to that which they would get
by offering sugar into intervention stocks, Vernes said.
    But Minguzzi said the offer was a commercial affair and
that producers had no intention of withdrawing the sugar offer
already lodged with intervention boards of different European
countries. He said final quality approval for all the sugar
offered could come later this week. Some 95 pct had already
cleared quality specifications.
    The EC can only reject an offer to sell into intervention
stocks on quality grounds. Minguzzi added that under EC
regulations, the Community has until early May to pay for the
sugar. He declined to put an exact figure on the amount of
sugar offered by Beghin-Say, but said it was below 500,000

5554,DANISH CREDIT DOWNGRADING NOT DRAMATIC - MINISTER,"Finance Minister Palle Simonsen said
today's downgrading of Denmark's credit rating by Standard and
Poor's Corp should not be over-dramatised.
    Standard and Poor's said it had downgraded the Kingdom of
Denmark's long-term external debt to AA from AA-Plus, following
the country's loss of the top AAA rating in January 1983.
    ""This change is regrettable but there is no reason to
dramatise. This is a change of nuance. Standard and Poor's
defines the AA category as only slightly different from the top
AAA rating,"" Simonsen said in a statement.
    ""The direct effect of the lower rating on our borrowing
capability is unlikely to be very great. But if, against
expectation, we fail to reduce permanently the external account
deficit... This will inevitably affect borrowing terms and
capability,"" he added.
    ""Standard &amp; Poor's has noted that in 1986 there was a series
of austerity measures designed particularly to cut lending and
encourage saving. Tax reforms have also gone into effect.
    ""If and when it becomes necessary, the government will be
ready to take any necessary economic and political initiatives
as it has in the past,"" Simonsen said.
   Standard and Poor's said weaker international
competitiveness in the face of rising labour costs would mean a
deteriorating current account balance and a rise in external
debt.
    The external current account deficit rose to a record
preliminary 34.5 billion crowns in 1986 from 29.1 billion in
1985, bringing total foreign debt to 265 billion crowns,
according to government statistics.
    Government economists forecast that the external current

18250,"U.K. BANKERS LAUD VOLCKER, UNSURE ABOUT GREENSPAN","U.K. Bankers for the most part lauded
outgoing U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker for his
achievements over the past eight years but expressed some
uncertainty about economist Alan Greenspan, nominated by
President Reagan to succeed him.
    ""One of Volcker's greatest achievements was the sense of
continuity and stability he gave to the international markets,""
said Carlos Santistevan, executive director of Libra Bank Plc.
However, it is uncertain how long it will take for Greenspan to
fill that role and the degree to which he can do so, he said.
    Greenspan heads his own financial consulting firm,
Townesend, Greenspan Associates Inc and was Chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers during the Ford Administration.
    ""He is a prominent and well known figure in the U.S."" said
David Lomax, Group Economics Adviser at National Westminster
Bank Plc, who described Greenspan as an ""orthodox Republican
economist"" who may be better suited to getting the U.S. Economy
on track than Volcker.
    But for the most part bankers in London are unfamiliar with
Greenspan's views on domestic and international economics or
the international debt crisis.
    ""I will be sad to see Volcker go. He is a central banker of
good repute with a general interest in protecting the U.S. And
international banking system,"" said Libra's Santistevan.
    Volcker knows and understands the problems facing indebted
countries, he said, adding that it is unlikely Greenspan is as
familiar with the problem and the personalities involved.
    For this reason he expects there will be little change in
the Fed's approach to the debt crisis, even as U.S. Commercial
banks take a harder line in dealing with the problem by adding
billions of dollars in reserves against possible losses on
third world debt.
    Another senior banker who deals with the Latin American
debt problem also doubted there would be much change
post-Volcker, but for other reasons.
    He said that despite U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's
debt initiative which called for greater contributions by
banks, governments and multilateral organization, government's
have done little to try to improve the situation, leaving the
bulk of the responsibility in the hands of the bankers.
    Despite the Fed's independence from central government, he
questioned how much impact Greenspan could have coming into the
job so close to the next Presidential election.
    News that Volcker would not seek a third term hit the
financial markets hard.  The U.S. Dollar fell sharply on
foreign exchange markets before reported concerted central bank
intervention by the Fed and the Bundesbank helped it recover
somewhat. Prices of Eurodollar denominated bonds fell about one
point, while prices of U.S. Treasury bonds traded here lost
more than one point.
    But despite the disruption in the markets, Lloyds Bank
Plc's Group Economic Adivser Christopher Johnson said the
announcement was well-timed, given the recent rise in the
dollar against the mark and yen.
    In recent statements U.S. Officials have said the dollar
has fallen far enough and at a White House briefing today
announcing his nomination Greenspan said ""there certainly is
evidence"" that the dollar had bottomed out.
    However, many economists here believe that the recent rise
in the dollar will be only temporary and that it will have to
fall further before America's huge trade deficit begins to
reverse.
    ""The dollar has further to fall, although it may take a few
years"" said Lloyds Bank's Johnson. He added that the important
thing is that there is a soft landing.
    Like other economists, Johnson is anxious to hear
Greenspan's testify at the Congressional confirmation hearings.
    ""He has everything going for him but he must establish
credibility. We have to hear his views on inflation and the
outlook for interest rates,"" he said.
    Some bankers criticized Volcker for taking too hard a
stance in combating inflation in the late 1970's when his
tightening in U.S. Monetary policy pushed interest rates to
record levels.
    ""He tightened more than the Republicans wanted and only
relaxed his stance when the Latin American debt crisis erupted
(in 1982),"" National Westminster's Lomax said.
    Lomax said that Greenspan, if appointed, will inherit the
agreements entered into by Volcker with other members of the
Group of Five industrial nations on the dollar.
    However, he said that the danger lies in dollar stability
being maintained because of a monetary policy that is too
tight. Too firm a monetary policy could send the U.S. Into
recession, which would not be welcome by European counterparts,
he said.

8621,DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER,"The dollar is expected to decline further
in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of
last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,
senior foreign exchange dealers said.
    Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers
said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of
147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.
Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's
accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the
dollar down, the dealers said.
    ""The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major
currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,"" said Koji
Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury
division.
    He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of
intervening to support the currency.
    ""This eliminated the widespread market caution against
possible joint central bank intervention,"" Kidokoro said.
    Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward
momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly
contain a further slide in the currency.
    They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5
billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,
and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars
through the U.S. Central bank in New York.
    Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve
would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but
some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148
yen.
    ""If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the
flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the
Americans don't want,"" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market
manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.
    He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month
when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close
their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.
    But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar
remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of
the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and
Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.
    ""The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in
stimulating its economy,"" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant
general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international
treasury division.
    In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of
economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to
boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its
trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on
the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of
parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a
sales tax.
    In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance
of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.
    Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the
Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress
would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.

5268,ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN,"President Leon Febres Cordero said
Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make
payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have
to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.
    Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was
forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the
slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to
private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16
billion dlr foreign debt.
    ""All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,"" the
president said during a visit to the quake zone. ""A government
as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain.""
    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil
would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able
to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.
    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17
dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs
a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.
    Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a
price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the
earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.
    Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would
be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and
salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet,
would be reduced.
    He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic
consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of
gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares
would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited.

5302,TECHNOLOGY/DESKTOP PUBLISHING,"This month's endorsement by
International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM> of two desktop
publishing software products should add some much-needed
standards to one of the fastest growing segments of the
computer industry, analysts say.
    Desktop publishing is a relatively new market but industry
analysts estimate that sales will reach one billion dlrs this
year and jump to six billion dlrs by 1990, fueled by the rush
of corporations to bring their printing and publishing needs
in-house rather than to more expensive outside printers.
    Printing is a big expense for most companies. Analysts
estimate U.S. corporations will spend about six to 20 pct of
their total operating budgets on publishing expenses this year.
    At a desktop publishing conference in Chicago earlier this
month, IBM said it will adopt Adobe Systems Inc's Postscript
typesetting language in future electronic printing products.
IBM also said it will support Microsoft Corp's Windows
operating environment as the graphics interface standard in
future publishing announcements rather than its own Topview
environment.
    ""IBM's announcement will give tremendous stimulation to the
development of the desktop publishing market,"" said David
Goodstein, president of the consulting firm Interconsult Inc.
    ""It gives users permission to go ahead and buy products that
are already available without being afraid that they will not
be compatible with whatever IBM does,"" he said.
    The advent of personal computers, laser printers and
graphics software has allowed users to design and print
brochures, newsletters and a host of other communications at
their desks for a fraction of the cost of an outside printing
firm. Analysts credit Apple Computer with creating desktop
publishing when it introduced its Macintosh personal computer
four years ago, with its easy-to-use formats and excellent
graphics capabilities.
     Since then Digital Equipment Corp, Xerox Corp, Apollo
Computer Inc and a number of other vendors have identified
desktop publishing as a major growth area. IBM entered the
market only last July when it formed its Publishing Systems
Business Unit. IBM's embrace of the already-widely used
Postscript, a language that interprets computer commands and
translates them into instructions for the printer, was an
acknowledgment of what is already a de facto standard.
    Both users and makers of electronic publishing systems said
the support of the world's largest computer maker was critical
to the language's ultimate acceptance by users.
    John Warnock, president of Palo Alto, Calif.-based Adobe,
said, ""Ten pct of corporations have (moved) into desktop
publishing but 90 pct are still sitting back and waiting for an
IBM announcement.""
    IBM entered a licensing pact with Adobe for Postscript, but
its support of Windows was not quite so broad. IBM recognizes
Windows as a standard but would not comment on the extent of
its commitment to the software.
    Windows, a program integrator, allows personal computer
users to run a number of different applications simultaneously.

7530,BELGRADE UNIONS ATTACK YUGOSLAV PAY FREEZE,"Belgrade trade union leaders have
joined attacks on a controversial wage freeze in Yugoslavia and
reported strikes spreading to the capital.
    Miodrag Lazarevic, president of the Belgrade trade unions
council, said the government must take responsibility for the
effects of the law imposing the wage freeze.
    Under the law, which was enacted on February 27 and will
remain in force until July 1, wage levels of the last quarter
of 1986 were reimposed and future pay rises were pegged to
productivity. The move has caused resentment and widespread
industrial unrest throughout the country.
    Another Belgrade trade union council leader, Predrag
Petrovic, was quoted as saying hundreds of workers had been on
strike in Belgrade.
    Yugoslav trade unions are an integral part of the communist
political system and their role has traditionally not been to
defend workers from the government. The criticisms by the
Belgrade union leaders indicated wider trade union resentment
of the law than earlier reported.
    The government has officially reported 70 strikes
throughout the country, although Yugoslav newspapers have
indicated there have been more.

Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by
permitting formation of financial services holding companies
involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and
securities.
    In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank
and Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, ""I believe
that increased diversification along geographic and product
lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.""
    He said he supported the idea of financial services holding
companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding
Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,
insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries
would be handled on functional lines.
    ""Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the
bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would
have to be on an arms-length basis,"" Heller said.
    Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'
special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.
    Heller said he ""would require the holding company to serve
as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to
maintain the bank's capital.
    ""In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as
long as the holding company has a positive net worth.""
    Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted
to own a financial services holding company, again with the
provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise
if necessary.
    Heller said the effects of these actions ""would be banks
that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them"" in
which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to
""loot the bank"" was removed.
    Such diversification would give access to national and
international financial services to corporations across the
United States.
    Heller said that would mean ""the steady decline of America's
banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested"" by
permitting them to become more competitive.

5857,STRIKES AGAINST WAGE FREEZE SPREAD IN YUGOSLAVIA,"Strikes against a government freeze on
wages spread to most regions of Yugoslavia last week, the
official news agency Tanjug said last night.
    It said thousands of workers were involved, and officials
feared more strikes were on the way.
    At least 60 strikes have taken place around Yugoslavia in
the past two weeks, but most of those previously reported were
in the northern republic of Croatia.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic imposed the wage freeze last
month in an effort to curb rampant inflation, now running at an
annual rate of almost 100 pct.
    The government froze wages at their level in the fourth
quarter of 1986 and said any future rises must be linked to
productivity.
    The measure met widespread disapproval. Even some senior
executives of major industrial enterprises have criticised the
freeze in interviews with Tanjug.
    The agency said strikes took place last week in the
southern republic of Montenegro and the predominantly ethnic
Albanian province of Kosovo. In the central republic of Bosnia

yesterday, an EC Commission spokesman said.
    However, he said he could not rule out such a meeting

currently holds the presidency of the EC council of ministers.
    The farm ministers could also meet in parallel with the
meeting of EC heads of government in Brussels on June 29 and

    The ministers ended their three-day meeting in Luxembourg
still split on the question of an oils and fats tax and with
West Germany saying it would use its veto on two other key
aspects of EC Commission proposals, the actual common price
changes and a revision of the ""green money"" system.
    The Commission spokesman said an announcement is likely to

8563,CHICAGO FUTURES LEADER SAYS MARKETS CAN ADAPT,"Foreign currency futures
markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries
agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band,
said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange's, CME, executive committee.
    ""The target zone would not affect our market I think at
all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy
market,"" Melamed told Reuters in an interview.
    ""We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a
four pct shift,"" he said, referring to permitted currency
fluctuations in the early 1970s. ""One thing you can adjust is to
make each contract a larger value.""
    As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental
in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial
to the Chicago exchange.
    Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can
approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by
governments to control currency fluctuations.
    ""They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an
hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's
unrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary.""
    The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the
exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock
index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would
help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity
markets on so-called ""triple-witching"" day.
    ""We think that the settlement in the morning will have a
salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think
this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change

go into effect, he said.
    Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders
of the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would
address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading.
    Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring
brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own
account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in
dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to
the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups.
    The changes ""will in time have an extremely positive effect
on the marketplace. That's going to prove very, very
instrumental in increasing volume over time,"" he said,
predicting the increase would come within a year.
    Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said
the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit
on the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could
not be a temporary program.
    The CME also received ""many negative comments, many more
than we anticipated,"" Melamed conceded. Many futures commission
merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event
the price approached the bottom limit.

foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Dollars and asked the cabinet
to diversify these holdings into other major currencies.
    A parliament statement said the criticism came from 18
Kuomintang (nationalist) legislators and several opposition
members, who asked the government to diversify reserves into
mark, yen, Swiss franc, other currencies or gold.
    It said that from September 1985 to September 1986 the
central bank's exchange rate loss was about 144 billion Taiwan
dlrs.
    Fourteen local banks lost 12.6 billion Taiwan dlrs during
the period, it said.
    In the same time span the Taiwan dollar rose to 36.77 to
the U.S. Currency from 40.45. It closed at 33.17 today.
    The statement said the central bank's loss this year would
more than double because of the rising Taiwan dollar and
reserves, which had reached 54 billion U.S. Dlrs last week.
    Government legislators said they expected the reserves to
increase to more than 60 billion U.S. Dlrs this year and the
trade surplus to increase by about 15 billion U.S. Dlrs,

180,U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT,"The U.S. Agriculture Department is not
actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet
Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA
officials said.
    However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not
been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in
the very near future.
    ""The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,""
an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. ""But there
just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally.""
    Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident
than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the
Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer
when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier
this week.
    But administration and private sources agreed that if the
Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to
Moscow, it could take several months.
    ""I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any
interagency process,"" the aide to Lyng said.
    ""An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,""
said one former USDA official, who noted that the
administration took three months to decide in favor of selling
China wheat under the subsidy program.
    An official representing a large grain trade company said
deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of
Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat
subsidy offer to the Soviets.
    But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to
Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the
secretary on the subsidy question a single time.
    The administration's interagency trade policy review group,
comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to
clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials
at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.
    In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the
administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any
new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the
consultations this week described them as an exchange of ""calm,
basic, factual economics.""
    Another USDA official said there was ""not even an informal
suggestion or hint"" that the Soviets would live up to their
pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were
granted more favorable terms.
    USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an
EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be
delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming
from the Iran arms affair.

17700,COMPUTER ASSOC. &lt;CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM,"Computer Associates International Inc's
800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate its
strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition
from International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, Wall Street
analysts said.
     ""IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems
software,"" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
and Jenrette.
    ""But the combination of the two companies will clearly
present a much stronger front,"" he said.
    Besides IBM, ""Computer Associates will be far and away the
most powerful company in the field,"" added E.F. Hutton analyst
Terence Quinn.
    That field is a segment of the market known as system
utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of
a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,
power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.
    The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the
two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.
Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that
will find the competition much harder than in the past.
    For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a
six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,
N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.
    When the deal is completed sometime in August, the
company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past 
Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent
software vendor.
    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang
took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought
15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3
mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.
    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer
businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe
computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.
    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the
merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.
    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six
companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.
    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on
sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.
    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely
because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,
Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the
dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or
56 cts a share.
   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different
businesses, only three of which were involved in computer
software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a
major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his
job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services
unit.
    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a
news conference that the merger would give computer users a
single source for a wide range of software products.
    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also
sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads
in the applications software market, where analysts said it has
been successful with accounting and banking systems.
    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and
enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the
company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said
about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.
    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of
current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But
they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute
Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.
    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of
completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,
he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05
dlrs a share.
    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations
of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing
and research and development.
    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.
Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50
dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly
33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.
    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most
software companies are currently valued at about 20 times
per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the
premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.

    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25
pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently
owns 58 pct of Uccel.
    The executive said the merger would not alter his target of
maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.
    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the
deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice
Department.
    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the
merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.

3558,IMF WARNS ISRAEL PAY RISES MAY THREATEN STABILITY,"The International Monetary Fund has
warned Israel in a report that a continued rapid rise in wages
could undo the achievements of its economic stabilization
program in controlling hyperinflation.
    An IMF delegation, which visited Israel this week, issued
an interim report praising Israel's success in slashing
inflation from 440 pct in 1985 to 19.7 pct last year without
triggering mass unemployment.
    But it held up Argentina and Brazil as examples of the
perils awaiting countries who did not follow up on
stabilization programs.
    ""Continued rapid rise in wages would threaten the progress
in reducing inflation and the present level of employment,"" the
IMF said.
    The report echoed warnings last week by Bank of Israel
Governor Michael Bruno and the private Bank Hapoalim that
higher wages, government overspending and a consumer boom were
rekindling inflation. ""Though wage developments and the
reacceleration of inflation are worrisome, there is still time
to put the stabilization program back on track,"" it said.
    The warning comes ahead of Israel's key public sector wage
negotiations next month.
    Bank Hapoalim chief economist Petahia Bar-Shavit said real
growth of wages in 1986 was about 10 pct, following a fall of
between 15 and 20 pct in the second half of 1985 when the
government's economic stabilisation programme was introduced.
    Hapoalim forecast last week that inflation would rise to
around 30 pct this year and a second devaluation might be
necessary later in the year, following the 9.75 pct devaluation
against the dollar in January.
    Bar-Shavit also said the government was implementing a
policy of cutting taxes without a clear strategy for balancing
the budget.
    The IMF report said monetary policy was relaxed too fast
last year and it supported the Bank of Israel's raising of
interest rates in the last month.

    He said Finance Minister Chung In-yong, Bank of Korea
Governor Park Sung-sang and officials of the Securities
Supervisory Board agreed that the stock market was over-heated
and decided to take measures to cool it down.
    Ministry officials said the recent market boom was fuelled

12394,DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987,"Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has seen a
slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986,
management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.
    Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the
year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak
German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and
trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency
dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.
    Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78
billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance
sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.
    Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the
former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one
billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's
own account, not included in partial operating profits.
    Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a
subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest
surplus in a section current earnings from securities and
participations.
    In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from
1.45 billion.
    As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.
    But it said that total operating profits, including own
account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick
transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the
parent bank.
    Banking analysts said this put group total operating
profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank
operating profits at over five billion marks.
    Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings
from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its
unchanged 12 mark dividend.
    The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself
because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,
and developments so far this year showed that was correct,
Christians said.
    West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are
sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent
years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.
    The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a
high level of risk provision, Christians said.
    Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in
1986 from 765 mln in 1985.
    Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily
reflect the full amount of risk provisions.
    Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said
Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen
to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985
because of the fall in the dollar.
    He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of
such problem country debt had been written off.
    Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of ""other
securities,"" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the
parent bank.
    Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due
to its increased activity in international share placements,
with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international
placement last year remaining on its books.
    Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to
place these shares and conclude the original placement.

18420,EC CONSIDERS NEW PROPOSALS TO END FARM DEADLOCK,"The European Community (EC) executive
Commission will today urgently consider whether to take a new
initiative to break the current deadlock over reform of the
bloc's farm policy and to ease its budgetary crisis.
    The Commission will meet in Strasbourg following what
diplomats described as a largely fruitless special joint
meeting of farm and finance ministers on the issue in
Luxembourg Monday.
    Commission officials said farm commissioner Frans
Andriessen will ask the 17-man body for permission to present
farm ministers with a compromise plan revising proposals for
1987/88 farm prices which have divided them since they were
first announced in March.
    The most controversial aspects of these proposals are a
plan to tax all vegetable and marine oils and fats to finance
rapidly increasing production subsidies and technical measures
which would change the way common EC farm prices are converted
into member state currencies.
    West German delegation sources, who have opposed both plans
fiercely, said if the Commission dropped the oils and fats tax
plan and modified the currency proposals, there would be a
chance of agreement on other aspects of the package.
      These include measures to cut the effective price paid to
farmers for cereals and some other crops by over 10 pct.
      But a Commission spokesman said any new proposals would
include plans for revising the current oils and fats and
currency regulations.
     The Commission is anxious to avoid a complete deadlock in
meetings of EC farm ministers here this week as it fears issues
could then be referred to the EC heads of government summit at
the end of the month.
    Commission president Jacques Delors, who wants to ensure
the summit has ample time to consider proposals for new means
of financing the cash-strapped EC, said yesterday it would be
""disastrous"" if farm issues had to be discussed by government
leaders.
    However, with a five billion European Currency Unit (5.75
billion dollar) EC budget deficit almost inevitable this year,
the Commission will be wary of making major concessions to the
traditionally free-spending farm ministers, diplomats said
    Belgian finance minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired
yesterday's joint meeting of ministers, said afterwards some
aspects of the farm price package will almost certainly have to
be referred to the summit.
    Although Delors' aides described the joint meeting as
useful in clarifying the issues, some diplomats said it seemed
to have merely confirmed member states' long held positions.
    Indeed, they said an extra state, Spain, seemed to have
lined up with the four others already opposing the oils and
fats tax, West Germany, Britain, Denmark and Portugal.

Monday of 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan collateral by
Fermenta's &lt;FRMS ST> founder and former chief executive Reefat

    A statement cited Fermenta's financial position as the main
reason for delay. The company's 1986 deficit had earlier been

extraordinary shareholders meeting last Monday to half a

share issue would not be launched but that another, estimated

accepting a suitable bid for them.
    Nordbanken loaned 200 mln crowns to Reefat el-Sayed

    Kaiser also said a pickup in electronics and computer
business would help this year's results.
    The company is trying to get a license to operate directly
in Korea before next year's Olympics, he said. It currently
works through an agent there.
    He said four countries in the Pacific - Hong Kong, Korea,
Taiwan and Singapore, where the company does much if its
business - should have economic growth of more than 10 pct over

with the U.S., A senior trade official said.
    Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters
on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week
that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would
face retaliation.
    Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S
responded to Taiwan's request to increase its textile export
quotas by promising further talks in May. Taiwan's surplus with
the U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986.
    Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year
limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year.

a major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S.

4191,CME CONTINUES DELIBERATION ON DUAL TRADING BAN,"Directors of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) adjourned a meeting late last night without
reaching a decision on a petition to ban dual trading in
Standard and Poor's 500 stock index futures, an exchange
official said.
    CME president Bill Brodsky told Reuters that the CME board
would meet again today and probably reach a decision either

    Dual trading involves the right of members to trade for
their own account as well filling orders for customers.
    The petition, signed by several hundred exchange members
when it was circulated on the floor of the CME two weeks ago,
calls for the elimination of dual trading in the S and P pit.
Some industry watchers believe that if the CME eliminates the
practice other exchanges will have to consider such a move.
    The practice has drawn criticism from some sectors in that
it provides an opportunity for abusive practices in which
customer orders are not executed at the best possible price.
    One practice, know as ""front-running,"" involves a broker
trading ahead of a large customer order and then profiting by
the impact on the market of the customer order.

continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results,
despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its

    Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended
December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared
to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago.
    Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and
analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's
Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the
industrial automation market.
    ""It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It
is moving forward with market development and is enhancing
market share,"" Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit.
    Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology
management conference, said first quarter sales for the
Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He
said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit
on a quarterly basis.
    Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the
research and development phase of government contracts should
not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance.
    He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing
could limit technological innovation.
    ""I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of
contracting approaches too early in the development stages of
important military contracts,"" Beall said, adding, ""long-term,
we have a very serious problem.""
    In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest
competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense

    He made the admission in a weekly radio address while
defending the role played by Secretary of State George Shultz

venezuela (pdvsa), champlin chairman william adams said.
    ""this was an aspect which was discussed at length during the
negotiations, but we can say our contract covers all
eventualities in this regard,"" he told reuters during the
signing ceremony here.
    Venezuela's energy and mines minister arturo hernandez
grisanti earlier described the agreement, under which pdvsa
buys 50 pct of champlin's corpus christi refinery, as ""one more
step in the maturation and presence of our oil industry in
world markets.""
   union pacific chairman william cook said the agreement will
be beneficial to both sides, combining a secure source of
supply with a modern refinery and access to markets.
    ""we are looking to a long-term relationship, and at a time
of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are
clear benefits to both sides,"" he said.
    Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with
an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over
the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan
heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and
obtain a competitive product yield.
    ""therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a
consideration in the negotiations, and it remains to be seen
what such a fee would represent, we do not foresee any impact
on today's agreement,"" adams said.
    He said the refinery could run crude as heavy as
venezuela's bolivar coastal field (bcf) 17 api without any
difficultiesand would probably move over time to a heavier diet
to take advantage of bigger margins.
    The refinery has a capacity to process up to 110,000 bpd of
venezuelan high sulphur content heavy crude, with an 80-85 pct
yield of white products.

profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.
    The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a
domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.
    It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln
mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover
possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary
because of recent declines in raw material prices.
    Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in
prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.

share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held
largely by family foundations.

Budget Committees are in general accord on the need to cut the
federal budget deficit by about 36 billion dlrs, half through
new revenues, congressional sources said.
    The sources told Reuters Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, believes that it would be
necessary to raise ""at least"" 18 billion dlrs in higher
revenues--the same being proposed by House Budget Committee
Chairman William Gray, a Pennsylvania Democrat.
    The Senate committee will hold its first drafting session
on a budget tomorrow, the House group later in the week.
    Both sides want to meet a congressional target of April 15
for congressional approval of a new budget. However, the
Congressional Budget Office said that a deficit cut of 36
billion dlrs will fail to reach the Gramm-Rudman budget law
goal of a 108 billion dlr deficit and would fall 27 billion
dlrs short. 
    President Reagan's budget, not accepted by either
committee, proposed about 36 billion dlrs in deficit
reductions--including some 22 billion dlrs in new revenues
through asset sales and excise fees--off of an estimated
deficit base of 144 billion dlrs.
    Reagan said his budget hits the Gramm-Rudman goal for 1988
but the Congressional Budget Office said it is way off the mark
with over optimistic economic assumptions.
    Currently, there are discussions underway by House and
Senate committees to redefine the fixed Gramm-Rudman targets
for more realistic levels that can be reached, which would push
off by a year or two the 1991 goal for a balanced budget,
sources said.

    The communique said the Iranian troops which attacked the
Qutaiba front were annihilated but the invading force managed
to gain some footholds on the other fronts.
    ""Fierce fighting has been raging since dawn today and all
morning where our forces succeeded in dislodging the Iranians
from all the positions they gained at the Muthanna front and
the situation ended in Iraq's favour,"" the communique said.
    It said Iraqi forces were continuing counter-attacks to

    The precise locations of the three fronts were not given. A
previous Iranian offensive launched in January towards Basra,
Iraq's second city, was halted with Baghdad saying the Iranians

13455,SINGAPORE STOCKS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE STRONG TREND,"The Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES)
will likely be used to raise more than 1.5 billion dlrs in
1987, continuing a long-term bullish trend that began last year
when about the same amount was tapped.
    Stock analysts and economists said the trend will be helped
by low interest rates and the government's plan to sell 380 mln
dlrs worth of shares in state enterprises each year for the
next 10 years, which should attract foreign interest.
    One foreign analyst said international fund managers are
increasingly attracted to Asian markets like Singapore.
    He said uncertainty over Hong Kong's future had helped the
flow of funds to Singapore over the last eight to nine months.
    Trade friction between Washington and Tokyo and the high
value of the yen had also diverted a trickle of funds from
Japan.
    But he added, ""A slight trickle will have a large impact on
the local exchange.""
    Economists said the inflow from foreign institutions is
difficult to estimate but it is increasing as the local
recession bottoms out with the help of reduced corporate taxes
cuts and of lower wage costs.
    Tan Soo Nan, director of the Development Bank of Singapore
Securities Ltd and a member of the exchange, said he expects
Singapore companies alone to tap around one billion dlrs this
year, but he warned there were some short-term risks.
    Corporate earnings in fiscal 1987 ending March fell short
of an expected 20 pct increase over 1986 and a major failure
would dampen sentiment, he said. He added the SES should admit
only companies able to sustain their earnings levels.
    But one foreign analyst said any slowing of activity would
be temporary and many investors are waiting for the results of
elections in Malaysia later this month.
    On the whole, Tan said, the long-term trend remains bullish
because of the economic recovery, the high growth potential for
the Asian Pacific region and the liberalisation of the Toyko
financial market.
    Tan said the introduction of the Stock Exchange of
Singapore Dealing and Quotation System in January and the new
government securities market was in keeping with the global
trend towards debt securitisation and financial deregulation.
    Singapore's economic recovery will be more broad-based in
1987 and the exchange's strategy should be to build up
expertise in risk and fund management, he said.

17549,HOLDERBANK EXPECTS 1987 RESULTS TO BE STEADY,"Holderbank Financiere Glarus AG &lt;HOLZ.G>
expects its 1987 results to be at least steady, with increases
in volume sales and negative currency factors roughly
cancelling each other out, deputy chairman Max Amstutz said.
    He told a news conference that turnover was likely to rise
20 pct in volume terms, partly through the consolidation of
recently acquired companies. Ideal Basic Industries Inc &lt;IDL>
of the U.S., Which Holderbank agreed last year to acquire,
should boost group sales by around 12 pct.
    But the weakness of the dollar -- the key currency for the

    Holderbank earlier reported consolidated 1986 net profit of
239 mln Swiss francs compared with 126 mln in 1985 on sales
which fell to 3.3 billion francs from 3.6 billion.
    Group president Thomas Schmidheiny said Holderbank was now

positions and to integrating recent acquisitions but the group

7304,NEW RUBBER PACT TO BE FORMALLY ADOPTED TOMORROW,"A new International Natural Rubber
Agreement (INRA) will be formally adopted tomorrow, chairman of
the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said.
    ""The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents
a significant step forward in international economic
cooperation,"" he told a news conference. The new INRA is to
replace the current one which expires in October.
    Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the
auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a new
accord last weekend.
    Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of
201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative
prices set in the present pact.
    Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint
Malaysian/Singapore currency, he added.
    The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of
price ranges -- the ""may sell"" and ""may buy"" points at plus and
minus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the ""must sell""
and ""must buy"" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it.
    Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that
were set in the present accord. ""The most important of these are
to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between
demand and supply,"" he said. The buffer stock remains the sole
instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and
its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto
added.
    At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt in
two years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be
resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference
price.
    It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price
every 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals.
    The extent of the adjustment was also modified.
    Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator
price has been above the upper intervention (""may sell"") price
(currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower
intervention price (""may buy"") price (171 cents at present) for
six months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or
whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council
decides.
    Under the new pact, the adjustment under these
circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a
higher adjustment.
    Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to
300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three
pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher
percentage.
    Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had
strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference
price and the ""lower indicative price"" (or floor price) of 150
cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently
360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes.
    The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last
Friday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend.
    Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of
the new pact.
    On the question of conditions for entry into force of the
new INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments
accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world
imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became
operational.
    The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.

18415,THREE U.S. EXCHANGES VIE FOR GOLD,"The glitter of gold has generated a
three-way competition among the world's largest futures
exchanges for a 100-ounce contract for the precious metal.
    When the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) re-introduces
gold futures trading here Tuesday (at 9 a.m. CDT), it will go
toe-to-toe in an uphill battle against the Commodity Exchange
Inc. of New York (Comex), which brokerage executives describe
as the world's precious metals futures capital for
institutional business.
    And by autumn, the oldest and biggest exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade (CBT), expects to join the fray when the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves a pending
application for a 100-ounce gold contract to trade side-by-side
with the CBT's smaller, one kilogram (about 2.5 U.S. pounds)
gold futures.
    The CME introduced a 100-ounce gold futures contract in
1974, but lack of interest forced it to abandon the instrument
in July 1986.
    CME officials said investors and brokerage firms asked the
exchange to reintroduce the contract because of recent
volatility in precious metals. Other factors influencing the
decision may also have been clearing problems in May which
forced the Comex to shorten trading for three straight days in
an effort to clear up a huge backlog of unresolved trades,
especially in silver futures.
    Comex's problems may now create a window of opportunity for
other exchanges to successfully offer precious metals
contracts, industry sources say.
    But it is much too early to predict whether other exchanges
can inflict serious damage on the Comex' daily trading volume
of more than 40,000 contracts which represents commitments to
buy and sell gold of more than 2 billion dlrs.
    While average daily trading in the CBT's smaller gold
contract, aimed at retail customers rather than institutions,
was under 500 contracts per day throughout 1986, it has
surpassed 1,000 contracts daily for the past two months.
    ""The climate could not be better for this venture by the
CME,"" said Merrill Lynch Commodity Marketing Vice President Neil
McGarrity.
    ""Everybody is talking about metals now, and interesting
daily trading ranges provide opportunities for bulls and bears.
There's good trading volume in all world outlets,"" McGarrity
added.
    ""The Merc's gold futures would be insurance for dealers,
merchants and customers that there would be a market open for
trading,"" if heavy gold or silver futures volume causes the
Comex to close early again, said Jack Lehman, senior vice
president and director of commodities for Shearson Lehman Bros.
Inc. and a Comex board member.
    Delivery points vary for each exchange's 100-ounce gold
futures. Comex contracts are deliverable through New York
warehouses while the CME contract specifies London delivery
through a CME account at Samuel Montagu and Co. Ltd., a member
of the London gold market. The CBT gold application specifies
delivery from New York and Chicago vaults.
    The Comex and the CBT have applied to the CFTC for an
earlier precious metals opening to match the CME's starting
time of 7:20 a.m. CDT. The exchanges said the earlier start
allows for trading before many important government reports are
released at 7:30 a.m. CDT.
    CME marketing sources said arbitrage possibilities exist
with side-by-side trading, noting local interests can be
generated by traders dealing in foreign currency and short-term
debt futures along with gold futures contracts to further hedge
their financial risks.
    ""If the dollar rises, traders can sell currencies and buy
gold,"" said David Johnson, CME's manager of currency products.
    The Chicago Board of Trade sees an extra advantage to gold
trading. ""Given our night trading session, we could add either
our pending 100-ounce gold or our existing 5,000-ounce silver
contract to attract overseas business,"" a CBT official said.
    Which market is identified as the precious metal capital
does not appear to be a major issue among professionals.
    ""We've seen Chicago bring in a new constituency before, with
perhaps different needs,"" Mocatta Metals Chairman Dr. Henry
Jarecki said.
    ""Merchants will go to the CME or anywhere to trade a liquid
contract. Our firm is no exception,"" Jarecki said.
    ""At worst, even if the CME gold futures fail, the Comex will
be under pressure to improve the integrity of its clearing
processes,"" a CME official added.

16948,WORLD BANK SUGGESTS MORE OPEN ECONOMY FOR INDIA,"The World Bank has suggested India
should move to a more open economy by gradually removing most
government controls on industry and adopting a liberal external
trade policy with reduced levels of protection.
    A confidential ""executive summary"" of a draft Bank report on
the Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggests
liberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports
of Indian goods by making them more competitive.
    The summary said, ""These reforms would result in (domestic)
prices much more in line with world prices than is true today,
and in a greater degree of import competition and export
rivalry than the nation has ever seen.""
    The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in
India's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal
imports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and
expose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports
would provide the foreign exchange for imports.
    ""The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present
principle of unlimited protection for all indigenously
available products and to recognise the role of actual or
potential competition from imports as a source of discipline on
the prices and costs of public and private sector domestic
manufacturers,"" the summary said.
    An Indian official told Reuters the government was
discussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some
changes was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to give
further details.
    The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's
final report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss
aid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June.
    The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew
at an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and
1986/87, which ended in March.
    It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of
gdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by
national savings, mainly from the private sector.
    India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed
to 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96
billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to
2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86.
    But the summary said the improvement was largely due to
lower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertilisers
which make up the bulk of India's import bill.
    India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign
exchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, the
summary said.
    The Bank's summary said there was little room for
complacency in the balance of payments position.
    It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87,
Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs.
    Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a
year in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable
balance of payments, the summary said.
    It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued.
India ""might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while
undertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that
involve some political costs,"" it said.
    ""An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an
exchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,""
the summary said.
    It said such an approach had been successful in countries
such as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain the
competitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduce
import pressures.
    Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that the
World Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boost
exports.

17307,TRADE MINISTERS SAY GOVERNMENTS NEED CREDIBILITY,"Four trade ministers ended a
weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments
are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not
regain it until they back their promises over trade and
currencies with action.
    ""Until today we have anounced policies, but when it came to
action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,""
Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference.
    ""From now on, if a government comes up with a certain
policy, it must be followed by action,"" he said following two
days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United
States, the European Community and Canada in central Japan.
    Last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140
yen, despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading
industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to
underpin world trade.
    ""We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have
confidence, then we can have an impact,"" said Tamura.
    His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought
over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free
trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired
confidence in the markets.
    ""The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you
belong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, if
you want to be credible,"" said EC external trade chief Willy de
Clercq.
    Pat Carney of Canada said ""We are meeting in a time of great
trade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have the
political will to deal with these problems we face.""
    She said that next month's meeting of the Organisation of
Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders
of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to
show this will existed.
    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news
conference that the results of such high level meetings could
lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out
world trade imbalances perhaps years later.
    ""The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings
like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it
should be pursued,"" he said.
    ""What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds
what is achieved in a tangible way,"" he said.
    Progress in personal contacts and understanding each
others' positions and policies was just as important toward
reducing trade tensions, he said.
    Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks:
    Currency stability was now essential, but currency
movements alone would not correct a U.S. trade deficit with
Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr EC
deficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplus
of almost 90 billion, he said.
    Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export
restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were
most dangerous, he said.
    The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies
over a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial
measures, and in line with a body of internationally agreed
rules, he said.
    In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-based
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be
strengthened, he said.
    The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to
solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its
large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its
industries.
    Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand
its domestic growth and rely less on exports.
    The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and
reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in
the Canadian economy.

2968,EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY,"As a British government investigation got
under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free
Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had
already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship.
    Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary
investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry
capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to
leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover.
    Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks
through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend
Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed.
    Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the
Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned
to pull them out of service at present.
    ""Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait
and see. But it is too early to say what happened,"" he told BBC
radio.
    As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged
hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts
had already been expressed about the design of so-called ""RoRo""
ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise.
    In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime
Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on
roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck
areas divided by bulkheads.
    Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German
yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety
standards.
    But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would
have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its
design.
    Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley
said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to
a barge.
    ""As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out
of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is
compartmentalised and you have more stability,"" he said.
    Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly
stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.
    ""If you do get water into that area then you can get very
severe effects on the stability of the ship,"" he added.

pct-owned Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO> were interested in Dome's
extensive Western Canadian energy holdings.
    ""But being interested can sometimes be different from

    TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP> yesterday bid 4.30 billion
dlrs for Dome, but Dome said it was discontinuing talks with
TransCanada and was considering a proposal from another company
and was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored
to be offshore.
    Asked by reporters if Dome should remain in Canadian hands,
Blair replied, ""Yes. I think that we still need to be building
as much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I
think it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadian
management.""

have hung over Western Canadian industry.""

couple of tough, tough additional years.""

9536,"JUSTICE, DOT BACK AIRLINE ANTITRUST SWITCH","Strong competition remains in the
airline industry despite a recent wave of mergers, a
Transportation Department official said.
    But Assistant Transportation Secretary Matthew Scocozza
said at a Senate antitrust committee hearing he would not
object to a transfer of the department's authority over airline
mergers to the Justice Department.
    Scocozza and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Roger
Andewelt said both departments felt airlines should be judged
under the same antitrust standards as all other industries.
    The Transportation Department is due to lose its authority
in 1989, but subcommittee chairman Howard Metzenbaum wants it
shifted now because he feels the Department has approved too
many airline mergers.
    ""Airline mergers have proceeded at a breakneck pace with
barely a whimper being uttered by the Department of
Transportation. Nine airlines control 94 per cent of the
market,"" the Ohio Democrat said.
    Metzenbaum said he was concerned about the effects the
pending U.S.-Air-Piedmont Airlines merger would have on
service, especially at Dayton, Ohio, a major Piedmont hub.
    Scocozza said even with the recent mergers, such as Texas
Air Corp's acquisition of Eastern Air Lines and People Express,
more airlines were flying now in the United States than before
the 1978 airline deregulation act.
    ""Airline deregulation has worked, is working, and, given
the department's commitment to preserving a competitive
environment, will continue to work,"" Scocozza said.
    He said the department considers the effect each merger
will have on competition over all the routes involved and will
not approve a merger which will reduce competition.
    Scocozza said most of the recent mergers involved airlines
in financial difficulty being taken over by other carriers.
     Andewelt said he was optimistic competition would increase
as airlines expanded airport hubs and routes and believed the
industry did not need special treatment under antitrust laws.
    ""It is time to treat the airline industry in precisely the
same way as other U.S. industries; any differences are not
significant for the purpose of merger analysis,"" Andewelt said.

would be raised to protect the currency.
    ""A further decline in the dollar or appreciation of the yen

    Currency speculators and investors are convinced that a
further dollar fall is needed to help reduce the huge U.S.

    Corrigan refused to say whether the U.S. was ready to risk
damaging its economic recovery by raising interest rates.

15323,U.S. FARM LAND VALUE DECLINE MODERATES--USDA,"The value of U.S. farmland declined
again last year, but less than in the previous year, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In a summary of its Agricultural Resources Report, the
department said on February 1, 1987, the average value per acre
of farmland stood at 548 dlrs, down eight pct from a year
earlier. Values dropped 12 pct in 1985, it noted.
    Real values, which are adjusted for inflation, also
declined less than in 1985, because of the low rate of
inflation in 1986.
    Real values fell 10 pct compared to 14 pct in 1985, it
said.
    The department said in the Corn Belt and Northern Plains,
which suffered severe losses in the past five years, declines
appear to be moderating. Also there are reports of stable
values in some areas of the Corn Belt, it noted.
    The continuing downturn in values reflects the large
acreage of land offered for sale relative to demand, concern 
about lower crop prices, and uncertainty over farm programs,
the department said.
    Those factors tend to offset the effects of relatively high
cash farm income, lower interest rates, and reduced operating
expenses, it said.

    There was no immediate announcement on the council's

frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices.
    U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on

    The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a
last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached
last July governing trade in semiconductors.

semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to
U.S.-made semiconductors.

duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments.

12640,BELGIUM TO SIMPLIFY BOURSE TAX SYSTEM,"Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens
said he will announce measures in the next few days making it
easier for non-residents to recoup the 25 pct withholding tax
levied on investment income in Belgium.
    In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also said he hoped
the cabinet would tomorrow approve the abolition of bourse
transaction taxes for non-residents, making Brussels one of the
few stock exchanges in the world where foreign investors were
not subjected to such a tax.
    He said both measures were aimed at attracting capital
imports, reducing Belgium's heavy net capital outflows.
    Under the present system, non-residents pay withholding tax
on their income from Belgian investments and can then reclaim
it from Belgian authorities.
    But financial analysts said the procedure for recouping the
tax is so bureaucratic and slow that it effectively acts as a
barrier to foreign investment in Belgium, especially in the
secondary bond market.
    Eyskens said he was ready to ""simplify and eventually
suppress"" the procedure for non-residents and would announce
details in the next few days.
    Financial analysts said the move would be far more
significant than the imminent abolition for non-residents of
the minimal bourse transaction taxes. These are set at three
rates - 0.07 pct, 0.14 pct and 0.35 pct - according to the type
of paper transacted.
    Eyskens said he hoped later to be able to abolish the
transaction taxes for residents as well, but this would depend
on progress in cutting the government's high budget deficit.
    He called the current 25 pct level of witholding tax ""much
too high"" and said he hoped to reduce it in the longer term,
perhaps as part of an overall reform of Belgian tax.
    But he added this would have to be done progressively
because of its budgetary impact. The tax raises 170 billion
francs a year in revenues, he said.
    Eyskens envisaged a cut to a basic 15 pct, after which a
rate could be set for each new security issued.
    He said that as well as aggravating net capital outflows,
the high rate of withholding tax also meant the treasury was
forced to borrow at higher interest rates.
    But he said it was politically impossible to reduce taxes
on investment income before those on earned income had been cut
as part of the tax reform, planned for late 1980s.

distributed to current and former employees. He believes many
of these indivdiuals will be inclined to sell the stock.
    Robertson says it's hard to determine the psychology of the
average employe, but even if a lot of stock is sold, it would
would not hit the market as one big block. He doubts it would
create a big downward push on the price.
    ""It's hard to call,"" said the analyst who requested
anonymity. In some cases employe loyalty may motivate
individuals to keep their shares, he said.
    Steven Lewins, analyst for Citicorp Investment Management,
believes the key to Conrail's long term outlook is how it is
able to invest surplus cash. He expects Conrail to earn 3.00
dlrs per share this year, flat in comparison with 1986, but by
1991 the picture could change dramatically if money not needed
for rail operations is invested wisely.
    By 1991, earnings could reach 4.30 dlrs per share, Lewins
said, factoring in reinvestment of free cash flow at
conservative rates.
    He believes motor freight will be one area of
diversification Conrail will explore.
    Elizabeth Dole, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, whose
department was responsible for the sale of Conrail, noted that
Conrail is required to reinvest in its rail system and cannot
defer necessary maintenance.
    For the historic offering of Conrail shares, Dole visited
the New York Stock Exchange and was photographed on the floor
wearing a locomotive engineer's cap, which she presented to
Stanley Crane, Conrail chairman and chief executive.
    The U.S. government is expected to receive about 1.88
billion dlrs for Conrail after factoring in underwriting fees
and other adjustments.
    The possibility of a recession at some time in the next
five years is another issue troubling some investors.
    Lewins says revenue-ton-miles, which he believes will climb
from 68.7 mln miles last year to 69.5 mln this year and 70.5
mln in 1988, will grow to 71.5 mln in 1991, but in a recession
year, perhaps 1989, the figure could dip to 64.2 mln.
    On the revenue side, he believes revenue per ton-mile will
be 4.7 cts in 1991, little changed from present levels and
exactly the same as in 1981.
    ""Their basic business isn't going anywhere,"" he says,
explaining why emphasizes investment of cash flow.
    Voytko thinks Conrail can remain profitable in a recession
year. He points out his firm, PaineWebber, is not forecasting a
recession in any specific year, but as an example a 1990
recession of modest degree could knock earnings down to 2.20
dlrs per share. He estimated 3.00 dlrs per share this year and
3.35 dlrs next year. His 1988 figure reflects mostly a lowering
of the tax rate to 34 pct from 40 pct this year.
    Voytko believes the Conrail shares merit purchase at the 26
dlr level.
    Goldman, Sachs and Co was lead manager for the offering. A
total of 148 firms took part in the U.S. syndicate.

10760,"COCOA DEAL SEEN POSITIVE, BUT NO PRICE GUARANTEE","The buffer stock rules agreement reached
on Friday by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) is an
improvement on previous arrangements but the price-support
mechanism is unlikely to do more than stem the decline in cocoa
prices, many ICCO delegates and trade sources said.
    The accord was reached between producers and consumers of
the 35-member ICCO council after two weeks of talks.
    European chocolate manufacturers and delegates said the
accord may boost cocoa prices immediately, but world surpluses
overhanging the market will pull prices down again before long.
    ""If the buffer stock operation is successful, I doubt it
will do anything more than stop the price from falling further,
and it will have no relevance at all to retail chocolate
prices,"" a European dealer said.
    And if the buffer stock manager delays too long in buying,
or is not seen to be using his purchasing power when the market
is relying on him to do so, the bearish trade reaction could
pressure prices dramatically, dealers said.
    The buffer stock is the market-regulating tool of the ICCO,
into which cocoa can be bought or from which it can be sold to
manoeuvre prices into a pre-set stabilization range.
    A new cocoa agreement came into force in January but
delegates could not agree buffer stock rules at that time.
    The new rules take effect immediately. The buffer stock
manager is expected to begin buying cocoa within the next three
weeks, after organizing communications with cocoa producing
countries and assessing the market, since prices are below the
""must-buy"" level of 1,600 Special Drawing Rights per tonne
specified in the agreement, the sources said.
    The buffer stock theoretically has funds to buy a maximum
100,000 tonnes within a five week period, but its approach will
be more cautious, buffer stock manager Juergen Plambeck said.
    The buffer stock has around 250 mln dlrs in funds and a
buying limit of 250,000 tonnes of cocoa, 100,000 tonnes of
which are already in the buffer stock.
    ICCO council chairman and Ivorian Agriculture Minister
Denis Bra Kanon said the new rules have a good chance of
stabilizing prices. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa
producer.
    ""We have established rules which will permit us to withdraw
immediately the surplus of cocoa on the world market,"" Bra Kanon
told reporters after the council adjourned. Bra Kanon reckoned
the world cocoa surplus could be less than half the 94,000
tonnes estimated by the ICCO statistics committee.
    However, some producer and consumer members emerged from
the final ICCO council meeting with reservations about the
pact.
    Ghana, whose high-quality cocoa is the world's most
expensive and provides 60 pct of the country's export earnings,
made a formal protest to the council about the price
differentials assigned to its cocoa, saying they were too high
for Ghanaian cocoa to be bought for the buffer stock.
    According to consumer spokesman Peter Baron of West
Germany, ""Consumers weren't perfectly happy with the buffer
stock rules. We reached a very sensitive compromise...There
were no real winners or losers.""
    Some European Community delegates were not satisfied that
important points were fully discussed during the talks, and as
a result, doubted the rules can deal with world surpluses as
effectively as they could have, delegates said.
    Under the new rules, the buffer stock manager would seek
offers of different origin cocoas, using price differentials to
reflect different qualities. Non-ICCO member cocoa can comprise
up to 15 pct of the total buffer stock.
    London cocoa prices traded today around 1,300 stg per
tonne, down from around 1,450 stg in January 1987 and 1,750 stg
in January 1986.
    A cocoa withholding scheme can take a further 120,000
tonnes of cocoa off the market if a special council session
decides market conditions warrant it, according to the
agreement.
    The withholding scheme can only be used if prices fall
below the 1,600 SDR lower intervention price for more than five
days and if 80 pct of the maximum buffer stock capacity has
been filled, or if the buffer stock runs low on funds, it says.
    The ICCO will discuss withholding scheme rules at an
executive committee meeting on June 9/12, ICCO officials said.

21277,TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS,"The Louvre accord on currency stability,
which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
last February, appeared in serious danger today as a
transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to
the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
the currency pact was still alive.
    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market
fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term
interest rates. ""That's not in keeping with the spirit of what
we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,""
Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was
referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group
of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
pact.
    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both
have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre
agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate
move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.
    ""The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that
he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets
are off in terms of currency cooperation,"" Chris Johns, currency
analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.
    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine
view, telling Reuters that ""the exchange market is apparently
reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker
comment will regret it later on.""
    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the
Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to
respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for ""a faithful
and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""
    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British
Treasury commented on the row.
    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite
U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, ""this does
not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
Louvre Accord.""
    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive
of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.
Was still committed to the accord.
    In a move which the market interpreted as a possible
gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term
liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on
Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also
stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,
injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
close to eight pct.

9344,FED ADOPTS REDEPOSIT SERVICE FOR BOUNCED CHECKS,"The Federal Reserve Board
unanimously approved a proposal to allow Federal Reserve banks
to offer a redeposit service for bounced checks.
    The service would allow a commercial bank that sends checks
to a reserve bank for collection to instruct the reserve bank

    The reserve banks would be required to charge a fee for the
redeposit service that would cover its costs.
    The plan would leave it to each reserve bank to set a
dollar cutoff for eligible returns.
    The Fed acted after industry studies showed that nearly
two-thirds of bounced checks cleared the second time around.

5943,EAST GERMANY ANNOUNCES ECONOMIC REFORM PLANS,"East Germany plans to devolve more
responsibility to factories and boost profitability under a law
obliging plants to generate their own funds for investments in
new machinery, repairs or expansion, the Berliner Zeitung
newspaper said.
    The state would no longer finance projects under five mln
marks under the law which took effect on January 1.
    The paper also hinted at further, more ambitious changes if
this experiment proved successful.
    Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has cited East Germany's
cautious industrial decentralisation as an alternative to the
Hungarian model based on Western-style market economics.
    The law stresses that East Germany remains committed to the
centralised state-planned economic system with no market
experiments.
    ""This new regulation is part of our general investment
policy,"" Berliner Zeitung said, citing the growing importance of
robots and high technology rather than the large-scale plant
construction of the 1950s and 1960s.
    ""This step could be the start of even greater changes in GDR
investment policy. We must wait and see,"" it added.
    Factory investment funds would be drawn from profits above
certain minimum returns pledged to the state under annual plans
and from amortisation -- funds the factory is allowed to keep
to compensate for depreciation in the cost of machinery.
    Amortisation costs and all profits currently go back to the
state, which provides all investment capital in return.

changes in world markets vital for the East German economy,

    ""That led us to expect that he would not be able to recall
(the date) when he appeared before the Tower board,"" Wallison
said, referring to the question of whether Reagan gave prior
approval to an Israeli shipment of U.S. Arms to Iran.
    Wallison said John Poindexter, then head of the National
Security Council (NSC), kept him from probing the scandal for
weeks after it was first made public last November, the Times
reported.
    Wallison told the newspaper that Poindexter, who resigned
from his NSC post last November 25, refused to give him
information about the deal, despite pleas by former White House
Chief of Staff Donald Regan.
    ""Regan told me on several occasions that he had been unable
to move Poindexter to include me in any of the discussions or

is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow

    Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year's
domestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export
of which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be
taken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and
the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations.
    Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75
mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports
from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export
needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to

1369,"U.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS","Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.
corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in
deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates
and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and
sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.
    Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to
the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman
budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.
    Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency
payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225
mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.
    The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents
per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were
received by producers requesting advance payments.
    Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference
between an established target price and the higher of the basic
loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers
during the first five months of the marketing year --
September-January.
    National weighted average market prices for the first five
months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and
1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will
be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the
3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.
    Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents
per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per
bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan
rate.
    The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the
maximum permitted by law, the department said.
    Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another
1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average
market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing
year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the
department said.
    The payments will be issued through local Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.

export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to

deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.
    Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss
an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.
    The additional output would be related to plans now under
discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while
it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.
    Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo
Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified
part of Ecuador's export commitments.

300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply
refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make
up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico
might supply Ecuador's South Korean market.
    Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months

18280,PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SEES STRONGER COPPER PRICES,"Phelps Dodge Corp officials said good
fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices
for the metal.
    In an interview with Reuters, chairman G. Robert Durham
said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices
up eight to nine pct on the New York Commodities Exchange last
month.
    ""Our customers in this country are living off the tailgates
of our trucks,"" he said, referring to tightness of supply and
strong demand. ""The fundamentals are good.""
   
    Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said;
""All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored.""
    He said copper supplies are lower than they have been for
almost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest on
record behind 1984, he said.
    Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with
annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.
   
    During the interview, executive vice president Douglas
Yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before
the copper price rose ""because there aren't that many new
projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
will continue to grow modestly.""
    Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to
more than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound
rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for
Phelps Dodge, the company said.
    ""Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction
and other areas,"" Yearley said.
   
    New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine
owned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's
&lt;BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's
own expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production
shortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.
    Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located
Chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production
at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter. The
company's total production costs, including depreciation but
before interest and corporate expense, should be below 50 cts a
pound by late 1989 or 1990, he said.

totalled only 136 mln dlrs compared to 1.13 billion dlrs in the
same month last year, director of the Banco do Brasil's Foreign
Trade Department (Cacex) Roberto Fendt said.
    In a news conference, Fendt attributed the weak performance
in the March trade balance to labour strikes in the country.
March exports totalled 1.43 billion dlrs, against 1.53 billion
dlrs in February, and 2.16 billion dlrs in March 1986.
    March imports amounted to 1.29 billion dlrs compared to
1.27 billion dlrs in February and 1.02 billion dlrs in March
1986.
    Fendt said that coffee earnings rose to 220 mln dlrs in
March from 110 mln dlrs in February while oil derivatives were
down to 54 mln dlrs from 58 mln dlrs in February.
    He said that although the March results were considerably
lower than the same month last year, the government's target of
an eight billion dlr surplus for 1987 should be achieved. The
January-March trade surplus totalled 526 mln dlrs, well below a
similar period last year, which reached 2.46 billion dlrs.

5039,U.S. EARLY MARCH CAR SALES OFF 2.2 PCT,"Retail sales of new cars by U.S.
automakers eased 2.2 pct in early March to the weakest levels
since 1983, with industry giant General Motors Corp &lt;GM> down
9.3 pct.
    Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both had gains.
    The decline by GM continued its trend of weaker sales since
the beginning of the 1987 model year, which has forced the
world's biggest corporation to cut its car production several
times through temporary and permanent layoffs at various
plants.
    Relatively weaker sales by all of the Detroit Big Three
carmakers have compelled the companies to offer a string of
sales incentives including cash rebates and below-market
interest loans in an effort to reignite the market.
    Incentives apparently had some success, analysts said, as
the seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate improved to 7.5
mln compared with about 7.0 mln in late February. The eight
domestic carmakers sold 8.2 mln units during 1986.
    GM said its sales of domestic-built cars in the March 1-10
period declined to 97,487 from 104,952 a year ago while truck
sales rose 14.4 pct to 40,131 from 35,081. There were eight
selling days in each period.
    Despite the lower car sales, the giant automaker had a
bright spot as its Chevrolet division, which is launching a
national sales campaign this month for its new Corsica and
Beretta compact cars, was up almost 21 pct when only
domestic-built cars were counted. GM's Buick division was also
up, by 11.4 pct, while Cadillac was down 7.8 pct, Pontiac was
off 10.8 pct and Oldsmobile plunged 41 pct.
    GM also showed an improvement in its market share to 53.6
pct from 48.1 pct in late February, which analysts said was
partly due to the increasing sales for the new Chevrolets.
    Meanwhile, Ford said its car sales rose 5.9 pct to 50,407
compared with 47,592 a year ago while truck sales gained by
12.6 pct to 35,814 from 31,811.
    Number three Chrysler's car sales gained to 0.4 pct to
25,286 from 25,191 while its truck sales gained 15 pct to
15,565 from 13,585. The truck sales were a record for the
period, the company said.
    Among the smaller makers, Honda &lt;HMC> said domestic car
sales rose 16 pct to 4,394 from 3,786 and Volkswagen of America
rose 4.9 pct to 849 from 809.

2364,HAUGHEY TO SEEK EC ADVICE ON IRISH DEBT,"Charles Haughey, leader of the Irish

last month's Irish general election, he will seek the advice of

punt foreign debt.
    Haughey told a news conference he is confident of being
asked to form a government when the Irish parliament meets next
Tuesday. Fianna Fail won 81 of the 166 seats in the February 17
poll. Haughey said an offer of Commission help on debt
management was made to him today by Commission president
Jacques Delors.
    Haughey said:"" Delors assured me we could have full recourse
to the Commission for advice, guidance and expert skills in
dealing with our overall financial problems, particularily in
the matter of debt management.""
    Noting current debt servicing charges are about two billion
punts a year, he added :""If we could achieve any significant
improvement in the management and reduction in the cost of
servicing, it could have significant budgetary benefits.""
    He added that he would seek advice, not a Community loan.
    However, Haughey said Ireland had in the past used its
position within the EMS to make borrowings in Europe at
favorable interest rates, notably for onlending to its farming
sector.
    ""It is a mechanism which we have availed ourselves of before
and we would look at it again,"" he said.
     Haughey said he regarded as ""almost paramount"" the
maintenance of the punt's current position within the European
Monetary System.
    He criticized the attitude of the outgoing Irish government
in recent EMS realignments -- the punt was devalued by eight
pct last August.
    ""Until 1983, the policy of the Irish government was to was
to adopt a neutral stance in any realignments within the EMS. I
believe that policy was right,"" Haughey said.

5486,FDA PANEL BACKS UPJOHN &lt;UPJ> BALDNESS DRUG,"The federal Food and Drug
Administration's Dermatologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted
unanimously that Upjohn Co's Rogaine baldness drug was safe and
effective.
    The panel recommended that the FDA approve Rogaine for
marketing in the United States, so long as accompanying
packaging and promotional materials disclose that the product
has only limited effect on male pattern baldness.
    The five outside experts attending today's FDA committee
meeting seemed less concerned about Rogaine's safety after an
outside consultant told them the drug ""appears to be quite safe
in the normal male population.""
    The consultant, Ohio State University Professor of Medicine
Carl Leier, said Rogaine's side effects were minimal, based on
a study of 10,000 individuals who have been getting the drug in
Canada, where it was approved for marketing last year.
    ""The Canadian record is quite a good one in terms of side
effects,"" Leier said.
    The experts urged the FDA to require a warning in the
drug's packaging that patients be monitored for heart effects
while taking the drug, such as irregular heart beats, changes
in heart rate, palpitations and fluid retention in the body.
    Rogaine, whose chemical name is minoxidil, has already been
approved by the FDA when taken orally as a high blood pressure
drug.
    But Upjohn is now seeking agency approval of it as a male
baldness treatment when put directly on the skin in liquid
form.
    Upjohn has previously claimed that, when applied to the
scalp, too little of Rogaine was absorbed into the bloodstream
to affect the heart.
    But panel members concluded that the amount absorbed
merited physician monitoring of patients taking the drug.
    Under questioning by panel members, Upjohn official Richard
De Villez acknowledged the drug in clinical trials produced
moderate hair growth on the crown of the head in only about 40
pct after 12 months.
    He also acknowledged discontinuing treatment would make the
new hair fall out.
    ""The Upjohn problem is that they have a tremendous placebo
effect,"" panel member Paul Bergstresser of the University of
Texas told the meeting.
    He said patients administered a placebo during clinical
trials typically had about half as much new hair growth as did
individuals treated with Rogaine.
    As a result, it may take patients eight-12 months before
they can tell whether thay are benefiting from the drug, he
said.
    In Canada, a year's treatment costs about 550-640 dlrs
(U.S.).
    An Upjohn official said no price would be set for the drug
in the U.S. market until it was approved for sale.
    During trials, the drug was found to have a bizarre side
effect on some individuals: It caused a state of sexual
dysfunction known as ""exagerrated erection.""
    Stewart Ehrreich, a former FDA official who conducted a
safety review of Rogaine before leaving the agency, said
researchers had found a number of cases of patients who had
exagerrated erections as a result of the drug.
    He said this was a common effect for drugs of the same
class as Rogaine, called vaso-dilators.
    FDA officials said they could make no prediction on when
Rogaine might be approved for marketing.
    Following the vote, panel member Dr. Robert Stern, a Boston
dermatologist, said Upjohn statistics had exaggerated the
effect of the drug.
    He said ""about one in five will have a substantial clinical
effect,"" which he defined as a significant growth of new hair
that made the patient actually look better.
    He urged insurance companies not to cover the cost of
Rogaine treatment in order to preserve scarce medical fund
resources.
    ""I would hope that insurance companies will take a strong
line that this is not a product we will reimburse for,"" Stern
told reporters.
    ""I think this is a drug that has some application for some
people, and I think some people will find it worth the expense,""
he said.
    But he said individuals should be required to pay for the
treatment out of their personal funds.
    Stern estimated more than 100,000 American men are already
using minoxidil on their scalps, outside the law, by grinding
up the blood pressure pill and dissolving in a solvent.

9714,PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS PROCEED WITH NARROWER FOCUS,"The latest round of talks between
Philippine officials and the country's commercial bank
creditors on the rescheduling of 9.4 billion dlrs worth of debt
are still proceeding, but with a narrower focus, Philippine
Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin said.
    He told a press briefing Wednesday that Manila has dropped
a two-tier interest payment offer, which would have given banks
a higher return if they took partial payment in new Philippine
investment notes (PINs) instead of in cash.
    ""The PINs proposal has been laid aside.... The discussion is
now on pricing (of just the cash payments),"" he said.
    Foreign banking sources in Manila said on Tuesday that the
Philippines had raised its basic interest rate offer to 7/8
over the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) but Ongpin would
not discuss details of the pricing negotiations.
    He also refused to speculate on when an overall agreement
might be reached. The talks have been going on for more than
three weeks.
    Manila originally offered to pay interest in cash at 5/8
over LIBOR or in a mixture of cash and PINs -- tradeable,
dollar-denominated, zero coupon notes that could potentially
yield up to one point over LIBOR.
    The PINs option was subsequently modified to guarantee at
least a 7/8 point spread over LIBOR but many bankers still had
grave reservations, seeing it as a possible precedent for other
large debtors to avoid paying interest in cash.
    The PINs proposal has now been left on the table as a
separate option for those banks, which might want to fund their
own investments in the Philippines or sell the notes in the
secondary market, Ongpin said.
    Under Manila's plan, the PINs would be redeemable at full
face value in Philippine pesos to fund local equity investments
at any time prior to their six-year maturity date.
    While the commercial banks had their doubts about the PINs
proposal, Ongpin said there was great interest on the part of
certain investment banks which are already active in the
secondary market for sovereign debt.
    Unlike current debt/equity schemes, Ongpin said, the PINs
would include no government fees and would be free from
""administrative hassles.""
    He said about six investment banks had been approached and
four had replied so far. One even showed interest in buying 45
mln dlrs worth of notes, he said.
    Ongpin said that by funding current interest payments in
the secondary market through the PINs scheme, the Philippines
could conserve at least one to 1.5 billion dlrs of foreign
exchange reserves during its planned seven-year restructuring
period.

in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give
an adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZ
Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> said.
    Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the
backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14
billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly
Business Indicators publication.
    ""For the past two years, the government has struggled with
an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it
sees as politically practicable,"" it said.
    The political climate meant there would be a continued
over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and
maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.
    ""The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival
of business investment will be further postponed,"" it said.
    The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by
export and import-replacement industries which had created a
false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of
payments crisis were past. ""Unfortunately, successful adjustment

14757,JAPAN SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN PARIS CURRENCY ACCORD,"Japan will seek to strengthen the
Paris accord on currency stability at the meeting of the group
of seven leading industrial nations tomorrow, Japanese
officials said.
    However, the officials travelling with Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified,
would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord,
which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in
February, to be strengthened.
    Currency target zones, or reference ranges, will not be
discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow,
the Japanese officials said.
    The meeting, which is being held in conjunction with this
week's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions, will
reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing 
the language used in the Paris accord, the officials said.
    Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early
in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates,
officials said, but they declined to disclosed the details of
that discussion.
    The Japanese officials also declined to detail what
Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint
intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on
independent American intervention.
    The officials said such a money market action to stabilize
the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan, which is
suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency, but also
for the benefit of the United States as well.
    As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its
domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus, Japan will explain
economic measures to the G-7, the officials said.
    However, Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the
Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today
because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by
the Diet, or parliament, despite the new fiscal year which
started April one, the officials said.
    Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own
economic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yen
in additional spending.

11823,TURKISH BANKS ANNOUNCE HIGHER PROFITS FOR 1986,"Turkey's banks are reporting a strong
recovery in 1986 profits, but a government drive to liberalise
capital markets poses new challenges to a banking industry
seeking to broaden its earnings base.
    A dozen of Turkey's 55 banks have announced higher 1986
profits so far, a trend bankers in the financial capital of
Istanbul expect to be reflected through most of the industry.
    But while Ankara's policy of liberalising markets offers
new opportunites to expand operations, some bankers see dangers
attached to a related drive to push down Turkish interest
rates.
    Bankers said the government's policy of fostering lower
interest rates could lead to a consumer boom and reignite
inflation, currently running at about 30 pct. They worry that
this could further reduce the industry's shrinking deposit
base.
    This has given added urgency to bank moves to build up
their capital market operations as Turkey's market-oriented
Prime Minister Turgut Ozal liberalises the financial system.
    Bankers said the 1986 recovery in earnings stemmed partly
from foreign exchange operations and trade finance. But a
growing volume of trading in government securities is now also
a major source of revenue for banks.
    Bankers said the proportion of bank profits generated from
the traditional financing of commerce and industry is falling,
and some have even been making a loss on these operations.
    The major challenge to bank profits in Turkey came in 1980
when the government, faced with its worst financial crisis in
50 years, raised domestic interest rates sharply to fight an
inflation rate of over 100 pct and launched an export drive.
    Deniz Gokce, associate professor of economics at the
Bosphorus University, told Reuters that banks were forced to
pay depositors real interest rates for the first time and
profits started to fall. Previously, rates had been below
inflation.
    Turkey's domestic banks also partly missed out on the
export drive as foreign banks moved into Istanbul and reaped
the benefits of trade finance with their added expertise. The
number of foreign banks has risen to 16 from just two in 1981.
    Although local banks tried to follow suit, Turkey's exports
declined last year to 7.4 billion dlrs from 7.9 billion in 1985
and bankers doubt there is enough business to go round.
    As a result banks, including a few foreign operations, have
started moving into capital market operations to broaden their
earnings base and take advantage of the relaunch just over a
year ago of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.
    ""When we saw that there was a demand and supply of money
outside the banking system, we could not envisage ourselves
excluded from these transactions,"" said Osman Erk, deputy
general manager of the private bank Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi AS.
    The number of banks active at the exchange, mainly trading
government securities, went up to 28 this year from 23 when the
market was revived in December 1985.
    Liberalisation went one step further last week when
parliament passed a law encouraging companies to go public.
Last month, Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi launched the country's first
commercial paper programme, for a joint-venture chemical firm.
    Medium-sized private Pamukbank AS announced a strong
recovery in 1986 pre-tax profit to 12.9 billion lira from 603
mln in 1985, while Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi profits increased to
30.6 billion lira from 6.1 billion. Bankers said both benefited
from trade finance and increased capital market operations.
    Turkey's second biggest bank, the private Turkiye Is
Bankasi, announced a profit rise to 35 billion from 32.3
billion in 1985.
    However, bankers said some banks have been ""window dressing""
their balance sheets to mask non-performing loans which are
variously estimated by bankers at between 20 to 50 pct of the
industry's 9,026 billion lira in total credits.
    Non-performing loans began to mount in the early 1980s as
industry failed to cope with higher interest rates and started
to default. Some banks continued to count loans as performing.
    ""After 1984 all banks started to be more careful in giving
credits, so the non-performing loans is a problem of the period
between 1980 to 1984,"" Erk said.
    But the problem of bad loans led to a rescue by three state
banks of medium-sized Turkiye Ogretmenler Bankasi AS earlier
this year when the Treasury, which acts as a watchdog body over
banks, discovered that the its assets were to a large extent
made up of non-performing loans.
    Some 51 billion lira out of the bank's 69 billion lira loan
portfolio was non-performing. But the bank had reported a 1986
pre-tax profit of 65 mln lira.
    Bankers cited this as a typical example of how balance
sheets could hide problems despite a drive by the central bank
to standardise accounting.
    Gokce said the only solution would be for compulsory
auditing by international accounting companies.

    The company, in a newspaper advertisement, said it has
started a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price,
and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, has
unanimously approved the bid.  The offer and withdrawal rights
are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be
followed by a merger at the same price.
    USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to
buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.
Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.
    USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough
shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont
on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of
Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain
control of Piedmont.
    The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont
provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's
prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to
Piedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of
shares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.
    USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to
be purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number
needed to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be
satisfied.
    In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of
shares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.
    In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share in
cash for 50 pct of Piedmont's stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAir
shares for each remaining Piedmont share.
    Last week, Carl C. Icahn-controlled Trans World Airlines
Inc &lt;TWA> made a conditional offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs
per share, a bid that was rejected by the USAir board.
    The Transportation Department on Friday rejected TWA's
application to acquire USAir on the grounds that the
application failed to comply with department regulations by
omitting necessary information.  TWA said it would refile

    On Friday TWA said it had already acquired four mln shares

18049,VOLCKER IN LETTER DECLINES NEW FED TERM,"Following is the full text of Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's letter to President
Reagan declining reappointment to the Fed:
    Dear Mr. President,
    As the end of my term as chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board approaches, you naturally have to consider an appropriate
new appointment.
   
    In that connection, you will recall that, upon my
reappointment as chairman in 1983, I felt unable to make a firm
commitment to you or to the Congress to remain in office for a
second full four-year term. Despite my reservations at the
time, that term is in fact now almost finished. However, I do
think, after eight years as chairman, a natural time has now
come for me to return to private life as soon as reasonably
convenient and consistent with an orderly transition.
Consequently, I do not desire reappointment as chairman and I
plan to resign as governor when a new chairman is prepared to
assume office.
   
    I will be leaving with a sense of great appreciation for
your unfailing courtesy to me personally. More broadly, your
consistent support of the work of the Federal Reserve during a
particularly challenging period for it, for the financial
system, and for the economy has been critical to whatever
success we have had.
   
    Without doubt, strong challenges remain for all of those
involved in economic policy. In that effort, I believe the
nation will continue to be well served by a strong Federal
Reserve System -- a system firmly dedicated to fostering
economic and financial strength and stability and able to bring
to that effort a combination of sound and independent
professional judgement and continuity beyond any partisan
considerations.
   
    May I add, too, my personal best wishes for the remainder
of your own term in office during which you have done so much
to restore a sense of confidence and self-reliance among the
American people.
    Faithfully yours,

    Furthermore, Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner
said G-6 central banks haven't yet shown the full force of
their commitment to the Paris accord.
    ""I'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the
scenes,"" Horner said.
    Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will
firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures.
    ""Coordinated, punishing intervention"" by the central banks
-- in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has
only smoothed out the market -- is in the offing, according to
Horner.
    ""I think we're near the top of the range in the Europeans
(currencies),"" he said.
     On the other hand, the upside target for the yen, which
set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract,
is at 0.007050, Horner said.
    Still, other analysts believe currency futures have yet to
peak.
    ""The basic trend in the currencies is higher,"" said Anne
Parker Mills, currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc. ""The market wants to take the dollar lower.""
    Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a
G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price
activity the remainder of the week, Mills said.
    In addition, although the market shrugged off relatively
healthy gains in February U.S. leading economic indicators and
factory orders Tuesday, economic data could play a larger role
in coming sessions, the analysts said.
    Friday's employment statistics in particular will be
closely watched, Sloane said, adding that a forecast rise of
250,000 in non-farm payroll jobs should underpin the dollar.

17242,BUNDESBANK CALL TO BONN ON OVER-SPENDING RISKS,"The Bundesbank urged the West German
government not to relax efforts to rein in spending when taxes
are cut in a 1990 fiscal reform package, saying that higher
expenditure could lead to a dangerous rise in interest rates.
    The Bundesbank's 1986 annual report said the government's
choice of measures to compensate for any cut in tax income was
a key political task. ""There will also be consequences for the
state's attitude on spending,"" it said.
    It added that, while tax cuts should have a stimulatory
effect on the economy, the government should not expect any
significant increase in tax income in the short-term.
    The reform will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, of
which 19 billion marks will be financed through as yet
unspecified measures.
    The Bundesbank noted that reducing tax preferences and
financial grants as well as raising some indirect taxes were
being considered.
    ""As experience shows that a tax cut is not self-financing
... The question remains of how the rest of the tax cuts will
be financed,"" the Bundesbank said.
    The Bundesbank noted that in 1986, spending had increased
by more than the three pct annual average rise for 1982 to
1986. If this three pct limit were exceeded over a long period,
there would be a danger that increased new borrowing would be
necessary to finance deficits.
    It added that interest rates in West Germany were now low,
partly because of a high influx of foreign funds. But the
situation would become more difficult if the government's
credit requirements increased massively. ""The anticipated
stimulatory effects on the economy from the tax cuts could be
thrown into jeopardy by higher interest rates,"" it said.

15437,"JAPAN CRITICISED FOR ""DUMPING"" OF BANK SERVICES","Japan, which has been accused of dumping
everything from steel to computer microchips on world markets,
is now under attack for alleged cut-throat selling of a product
of a different sort -- banking services.
    At meetings here this week, Bank of England officials
pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that
foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair
advantage in world financial markets.
    The technical banking talks coincided with, but were
separate from, discussions between Japanese officials and
British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard, who left
Tokyo yesterday for South Korea.
    At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various
countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must
put up to back up their loans.
    It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms the
bulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about what
else should be included.
    Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals can
undercut them on loans and other banking services because
Tokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet.
    The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage, Paul Hofer,
head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan, told Reuters.
    Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido said, ""They
see us as very aggressive. We say we are just trying to catch
up with them.""
    Earlier this year, the United States and Britain agreed to
adopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capital
equivalent to at least six pct of total assets. The two
countries urged others to follow suit, notably Japan.
    But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little
hope that would happen soon as they just introduced new
regulations governing capital ratios last May.
    Under those regulations, banks have until 1990 to attain a
capital ratio of four pct. But, in tacit recognition of
overseas pressure, the ministry set a six pct target for
Japanese banks with overseas branches.
    But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's
banks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of
Japanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital.
    Without the shares, big Japanese banks would only have
capital ratios of around three pct. With them, their ratios are
well above six pct, especially after the recent record-breaking
climb of Tokyo share prices.
    Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too
high by the ministry. Japanese banks would never be able to
realize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell
the shares to raise funds in an emergency, they say.
    Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by saying
that studies of the stock market over the last 30 years show
that prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level.
    But the U.S. Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise.
Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up
applications for bank licenses by Japanese financial
institutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of
their hidden reserves.
    The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with the
Fed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talks
on the subject.

fining him 5,000 dlrs and censuring him.
    NASD did not immediately identify Woltz' former employer.
    The NASD said the disciplinary action was instituted by its
Market Surveillance Committee for alleged violations of
anti-fraud provisions under its Rules of Fair Practice.
    The association said Woltz consented to the sanctions
without admitting or denying allegations and the suspension
will start April 27 and run through May 22.
    It said its complaint alleges that from March 25, 1985 to
April 4, 1985 Woltz engaged in a manipulative and deceptive
practice known as marking the close of the market in a NASDAQ
security. The NASD did not identify the security.
    The NASD said the complaint alleges that Woltz, while his
firm owned a long inventory position in the security, caused
the firm's quotations of the security to rise on five days
within five minutes of the market close, causing the firm's bid
price to be the exclusive high bid at the market close on four
days and the shared high bid on the other day.
    It said the complaint alleges that before the market opened
on each of the following business days, Woltz caused the firm's
quotation to fall below its closing bid of the prior day.  At
no time did the firm execute transactions at the
artificially-raised prices, the NASD said.
    The NASD said the complain also alleges that Woltz violated
Article III, Sections 1, 5 and 18 of the Rules of Fair Practice.

&lt;NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms
to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,
Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.
    The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln
Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether
(MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.
    The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada
Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line
Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.
    The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials
availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the
important capital and operating advantages gained by locating
on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.
    The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant
producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer
that can replace tetra ethyl lead.
    Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States
where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of
health concerns, the statement added.
    Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the
U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in
Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,
it said.
    Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five
billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a
major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.
    The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on

7391,TALKING POINT/AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP>,"American Express Co's plan to sell a
stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a
prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,
analysts said.
    American Express earlier said it has a general
understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a
13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.
    The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,
as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment
in the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.
    The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to
the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.
firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a
price of 2.7 times book value.
    Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,
depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider
trading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8
times book value.
    American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. For
the last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of
a spinoff of part of Shearson.
    Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will
benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly
important Tokyo financial markets.
    ""I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step,"" said
Long.
    ""What you will see probably in the future is American
Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and
have a public vehicle for Shearson,"" Long said.
    ""Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment
into an illiquid situation,"" he said of Nippon.
    Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in
Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like
other investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.
    American express has said the total employees of shearson
will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that
number is substantially lower than growth last year, a company
spokesman said.
    American Express officials would not comment beyond a
statement made this morning. That statement, however, did not
close off the possibility of a public offering or other option
for Shearson.
    David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible
Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes
the firm will digest the Nippon investment first.
    ""I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with
the money they have,"" he said.
    Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said
American Express could determine to sell shares to the public.
    In its statement, the financial services giant said it is
continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to
the investment by Nippon.
    American Express said options under study range from
expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition
to broadening its access to capital.
    American Express also said the options reflect the
continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'
worldwide financial services strategy.
    Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a
Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to
Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.
    Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.
    ""Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They
don't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital
growth,"" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other
U.S. brokerage companies.
    Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are
interested in the expertise of American brokers. ""Those
(Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have

10246,FED DATA INDICATE POLICY LIKELY TO STAY ON HOLD,"Federal Reserve data released today
indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks
and that none is likely at next week's Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) meeting, economists said.
    ""The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of
reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since
the beginning of this year,"" said Harold Nathan, economist at
Wells Fargo Bank.
    ""These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not
change policy,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co.
    ""The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no real
reason for it to change policy,"" said Joseph Liro of S.G.
Warburg and Co Inc.
    Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does
not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates
may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges.
    All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern
now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was
heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting
the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering
interest rates further.
    Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with
expectations and similar to the data for most of this year.
    The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln
dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday
versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period.
    In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the
discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs
compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement
period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to
6.14 pct from 6.08 pct.
    The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday
and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data
released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves.
    The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any
pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to
boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to
meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg.
    Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week
borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually
averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that
was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period.
    Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for
two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln
dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of
around 6.10 pct.
    It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings
target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said
Wells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on
the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to
6-1/4 pct band.
    Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need
are anticipated for the statement period that began today.
 More
    Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four
billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro
puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs.
    To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to
add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to
buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar
coupon ""pass"" may be required later.
    There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement
period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further
upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window
dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31.

1540,BUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM,"The Bundesbank is planning changes in
the system by which banks bid for funds in securities
repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open
market instrument, central bank officials said.
    Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender
process to two days from three currently, enabling the
Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it
chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly.
    The changes will probably come into force in April.
    Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at
the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank
for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business.
    Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody
accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks,
which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level.
    Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such
accounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area.
    The change to come into force next month will allow the
Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself,
in a process legally comparable to direct debiting.
    At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on
Monday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the
result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday.
    The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28
days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or
longer tender periods being necessary.
    For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday
to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow
(Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the
carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt
yesterday (Tuesday).
    Central bank officials and money market dealers said the
shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely
technical, with no direct implications for interest rates.
    ""It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,""
said an official at the Hesse LZB.
    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December
that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater
success since their introduction in their present form two
years ago, and praised their flexibility.
    The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact
instrument even more flexible, banking economists said.
    By speeding up the tender process, they will make it
possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for
periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks,
to respond to changing money market conditions.
    ""With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be
refined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates,"" said
Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann
Remsperger.
    The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money
market developments, but by steering liquidity, not interest
rates, he said.

    Commenting on GM's previously announced move to replace the

12878,WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH,"Dutch dairy and general foods
manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV &lt;WESS.AS>, said it is
planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong
profit growth over the next 10 years.
     Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the
presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987
first quarter profits to show an increase.
    The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986
net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.
    This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's
guilder value, van Driel said.
    Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders
higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985
level of 3.20 guilders.
    Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln
guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw
material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.
    US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover,
compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate
businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.
    Van Driel said the company would continue an active
takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more
than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.
    He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition
possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.
    He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln
guilders and would if necessary make new share issues.
    Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln
dlrs. He said &lt;Balanced Foods> and &lt;Green's Dairy>, taken over
late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs
which was not included in the 1986 account.
    All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13
pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to
this growth was the successful introduction of new products,
which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US
acquisitions, van Driel said.
    Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986
turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.
    The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich,
Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to
be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.
    Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be
accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles
for the company to raise capital for future expansion.
    He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in
foreign hands.
    The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a
listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step,
van Driel said without elaborating.
    Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces
around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects
for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said.

18457,ZINC CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTFALL SEEN IN 1988,"Next year is likely to see a shortfall
in zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although there
should be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltd
metals analyst Stephen Briggs said.
    Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metals
conference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted
100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 was
the imminent cessation of new mining and termination of milling
at Pine Point in Canada.
    However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles.
    Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there was
unlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in
1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one of
record production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipated
in Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacity
in South Korea.
    ""Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are also
expected in 1987,"" Briggs said.
    This would partly be due to a return to more normal levels
at existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied with
achievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faro
in Canada.
    Looking further forward, the major event was the probable
opening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacity
of 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year.
    ""Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that there
will be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s,"" he
added.
    The picture for lead was also closely allied to that of
zinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and therefore
supply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products from
zinc mines.
    ""On this basis, our calculations point to a modest
oversupply of lead concentrates in 1987,"" Briggs said.
    The copper forecast, however, was for a record
non-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987,
increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988.
    Production of primary refined copper metal would also
increase, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading to
a moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnes
this year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of the
decade, he said.

14987,STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD,"West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries
would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on
stabilizing foreign exchange rates.
    Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness
of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and
Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
    But he declined to say what measures would be discussed
ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later
today.
    Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre
accord, had been underestimated.
    Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major
countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major
trading partners.
    ""There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,"" he
said. ""We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do
not want to discuss that here.
    Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a
""slight firming"" of the yen against the dollar.
    And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell
marks to support the dollar.
    ""The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,"" he
said.
    Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the
bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.
    Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its
pledges for economic stimulation.
    ""And we will have to see if the United States is able to do
what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --
and get it through Congress,"" he added.
    Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further
fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against
the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.
    ""You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And
it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,"" he
said.

419,BRAZIL CRITICISES ADVISORY COMMITTEE STRUCTURE,"Brazil is not happy with the existing
structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates
its commercial bank debt, Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said.
    U.S. Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee
while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks, he said,
adding ""This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks.""
The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983,
however.
    Noting the often different reactions of U.S., Japanese and
European banks, Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt
an approach involving separate discussions with the regions.
    Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a
case-by-case basis, ""Perhaps the same principle should apply to
creditors,"" central bank president Francisco Gros said.
    Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest
payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks, followed
last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited
by foreign banks and institutions, worth some 15 billion dlrs.
    Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in
Washington talking to government officials and international
agencies and will this week visit Britain, France, West
Germany, Switzerland and Italy for discussions with
governments.
    Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson, Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and
Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton.
    Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes U.K. Banks around
8.5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans, giving the U.K.
The third largest exposure after the U.S. And Japan.
    The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus, its chief
means of servicing its foreign debt, started to decline sharply
and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the
country's&#127;ate of inflation.  Reserves were reported to have
dropped below four billion dlrs.
    Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems
with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only
partial servicing of the debt.
    ""What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance
for part of the service, because we cannot service all that,"" he
said. ""I really think we have to change the old rules.""
    Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments, rather
than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a
solution to the crisis, Funaro said ""We must first talk to the
governments and then we can talk to the banks, because the
banks have some limits.""
    ""It is a political discussion from our point of view,"" he
said.
    Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to
Japanese and Canadian government officials. He would then talk
to the commercial banks ""If I've got some solution from the
governments. I can't take the burden only to the banks."" He was
not sure how long it would take to reach a solution.
 &#127;  In discussions with governments Brazil would review the
mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in
need. Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually
closed since 1982. ""You must open these mechanisms,"" he said.
    He said that while the U.S. Officials had been disturbed by
Brazil's suspension of interest payments, they understood
Brazil had no other choice, as it had to protect its reserves.
    Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed ""because
we can't stay as we were the last few years.""
    ""I'm trying to put the problem on the table.... All of us
would like to have a kind of equilibrium."" he said. Although
Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy, Funaro paid a call
in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to
World Bank President Barber Conable.
    Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to
decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight
billion dlr trade surplus in 1987.
    Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had
declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last
year, against a monthly one billion in the first nine months.
    Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world,
Funaro said, although its share of international trade was only
one pct.  ""The solution is linked with growth, not recession,"" he
said, noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and
inducing an internal recession in order to service debt.
    Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments,
as opposed to commercial banks, now benefit from a sounder
structure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Club
of creditor nations of 4.12 billion dlrs of official debt.

5827,ZAMBIA STOPS SENDING COPPER THROUGH SOUTH AFRICA,"Zambia has stopped sending its copper
exports through South Africa, the official Times of Zambia
said.
    The newspaper yesterday quoted highly placed sources as
saying the state-owned Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM)
was diverting its mineral exports away from South Africa, but
it did not say which alternative routes were being used.
    ZCCM officials declined to comment on the report, but
Standwell Mapara, general manager of the Tanzania-Zambia
Railway Authority (TAZARA), told Reuters recently virtually all
Zambian mineral exports had been channelled along the TAZARA
line to Dar es Salaam for the last three months.
    During that period no Zambian copper had been shipped
through Zimbabwe to the Mozambican port of Beira - the only
other available route which avoids South Africa, Mapara said.
    Last December TAZARA carried 36,000 tonnes of Zambian
mineral ore, the line's record for any one month period, he
added.
    Copper, cobalt and other mineral exports account for 95 to
98 pct of Zambia's foreign exchange earnings and President
Kenneth Kaunda told Reuters in a recent interview it was vital
for his country to assure new outlets for them, avoiding the
traditional route through South Africa.
    Referring to Zambia's preparations for a possible cut in
economic links with South Africa, Kaunda told Reuters in an
interview on March 1, ""My main concern, of course, is the mines
because whatever happens we must continue to run the mines.""
    According to Mapara, TAZARA handled 1.1 mln tonnes of
freight last year and is still working well below its present
1.4 mln capacity. Kaunda said that once preparations had been
completed for evacuating Zambia's mineral exports on safe and
dependable routes his government would look to increase its
usage of TAZARA for other types of cargo.
    The 1986 annual report of Zambia's state-run Metal
Marketing Corporation said 81 pct of the country's metal
exports were channelled through Dar es Salaam last year, versus
79 pct in 1985. The report said Zambian copper production fell
to 463,000 tonnes last year from 526,000 in 1985.
    Despite the official optimism about diversifying Zambia's
export routes, diplomatic sources in Lusaka expressed
reservations about the capacity of Dar es Salaam and Beira
ports to handle all of Zambia's mineral exports, even if they
could be hauled there by train.
    ""The two ports cannot in any way and in their present form
handle the huge exports of Zambian copper,"" one western diplomat
said.
    ""A serious disruption in copper movement to the markets
could be brought about as it would pile up at the two ports
which lack the facilities and space to handle the copper
tonnage,"" he added.

said that he opposes a Federal tax increase to help reduce the

and I'm quite confident that President Reagan doesn't think
it's a very good idea,"" Baker said in an interview on Cable
News Network's ""Moneyline"" television program.
    He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP
which is traditionally where it has been, but the Federal
Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP. Baker said
spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits.
    Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by
House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex, or other special taxes.
    ""The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate
approach to take,"" the Treasury Secretary said. He said the
United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in
the world and new taxes would impair efficiency.
    On the international front, Baker said banks must do more
lending to developing countries. He was questioned about this
after the Standard and Poor's Corp downgrading today of the
debt of six major money center bank holding companies, largely
because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure.
    Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market
economic policies such as in the United States. He said capital

20705,AMERICAN EXPRESS SAYS ITS STRATEGY IS STABLE,"American Express Co's &lt;AXP> president
Louis Gerstner Jr. said a bear market will not effect his
company's long-term strategy.
    ""I don't think where the market goes over any month long
period, two day period, or even six month period has anything
to do with our strategy,"" Gerstner told Reuters.
    ""We have built a strategy for our company that looks out
over many years and anticipates a lot of change,"" he said.
    Gerstner said the company's long term strategy is to build
and maintain a major position in the financial and travel
service industries. American Express is the 69 pct parent of
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc &lt;SHE>.
    Gerstner would not comment on the share market tailspin.
    However, American Express chairman James Robinson said in a
statement that the company could endure the market turbulence
and was in a strong position for further growth.
    ""All brokerage firms make money if the market goes down or
up,"" Gerstner told Reuters without elaborating.
    Gerstner said Shearson had no plans to quit its municipal
bond activities. ""Shearson Lehman Brothers tends to adjust to
trends in incremental steps. You will see it doing less of the
convulsive one-time changes that people in this industry will
go through,"" he said. Shearson recently laid off 150 people in
London and is limiting hiring, but Gerstner said American
Express remains committed to the London market and to having a
global presence.
    ""That Shearson let a couple of hundred people go in London
is not even an anthill on the landscape we're discussing. We
are discussing long-term strategy,"" Gerstner said.
    Earlier this year, American Express sold 13 pct of its
stake in Shearson to Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan and a
further 18 pct to the public. Gerstner said these moves ""had no
implications of an exit from financial services.""
    ""Our committment globally is represented by the Nippon
tie-up which dwarfs the fact we decided to reduce the size of
one department, in one company, in one of our subsidiaries,"" he
said.
    Many securities firms now are stressing merchant banking to
bolster earnings hurt by bond market volatility, slow retail
business and a drop in underwriting volume.
    When asked if more players would make the system more
risky, Gerstner said, ""I can't comment on other firms, but
Shearson is not going to follow a feeding frenzy in the
direction of merchant banking. We are not going to overreach.""
    Gerstner also spoke about securitization, or the
repackaging of debt as marketable securities.
    ""It is almost imperative to create a security backed by the
funds flowing from an LDC (lessor developed countries) debt
program. It is going to happen, but it is very difficult to
create a security in the current climate,"" Gerstner said.
    ""Securitized products could be structured for either the
retail or institutional markets,"" Gerstner said.
    ""If you look at the junk bond phenomenom, it started out
with mostly institutional buyers. Primarily through mutual
funds, individual buyers became a presense in the market. I'd
guess we'd see a similiar situation in LDC debt,"" he said.
    ""The fundamental thing that has to happen (before there can
be sucessful securitization) is that the debt burden on the
countries has to be reduced, and the amount of money coming
from the commerical banks and the future call for money on
commercial banks has to be reduced,"" Gerstner said.

13738,PALM OIL OUTPUT SEEN DROPPING SHARPLY - OIL WORLD,"Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil
production is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower
yields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.
    The publication expects total Malaysian output during
Jan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. For
East Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000
tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75
mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.
    It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both
countries, but the effects of this will not be felt until
1988-90.
    Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees
reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male
inflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.
    Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected
this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could
especially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June,
while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and
July/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.
    Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's
yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three
years, Oil World said without elaborating.
    Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year
were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in
January 1986, Oil World said.
    West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop
500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East
Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.
    Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about
eight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall
Indonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct
to 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however,
are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.
    Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are
both running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the
country's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during
Jan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of
the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival
throughout May, it said.
    Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to
350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent
Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the
country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill
Indonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.

    The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders

    Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow

18683,N.Y. FED PRESIDENT URGES BANK REFORM,"New York Federal Reserve President E.
Gerald Corrigan said he favors bank reform but wants to
maintain the separation of banking and commerce.
    ""As I see it, the case for fundamental reform in our banking
and financial system is compelling,"" Corrigan told the Senate
Banking Committee.
    Corrigan said he believed bank reform should allow banks to
offer a broad range of banking and financial services.
    He said common ownership of banks, thrifts, securities
firms and insurance companies should be allowed but commercial
firms should not own or control insured depositories.
    Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wisc) said he would
press for bank reform legislation this year and supported
giving banks new power for commercial paper, mortgage-backed
securities, municipal bond underwriting and mutual funds.
    Former Citicorp Chairman Walter Wriston said bank reform
should reflect the reality that other companies were offering
banking services such as checking accounts credit cards and
mortgages.
         
    ""The reality is that there is one-stop financial shopping at
banks in some states, but not in others,"" Wriston said.
    ""There is also one-stop financial shopping in all 50 states
at a Sears store or American Express office.""
    ""We must find ways for banks to deliver new products to new
customers in order to maintain a spread of risk in a business
that is rapidly losing traditional products and customers,"" he
said.

final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.
    The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared
with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and
shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in
the group's other divisions.
    The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic
group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend
partly on the level of provisions.
    Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine
marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped
to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.
    The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks
in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.
Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.
    The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by
unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by
poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.
    The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter
of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an
additional factor behind the drop in results.
    Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced
would not begin to take full effect until this year.
    Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion
marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first
time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its
majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.
    Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone
was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison
figures.
    Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0
pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose
to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.
    Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)
subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group
accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of
last year.
    AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the
international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world
group losses that year.

4603,COLOMBIA'S COFFEE MARKETING TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE,"Colombia intends to improve the
marketing of its coffee with the accent on more flexibility on
setting export registration prices, finance minister Cesar
Gaviria said.
    Speaking to reporters after announcing a lower export
registration price, or reintegro, of 1.10 dlr per lb ex-dock
New York, Gaviria said export mechanisms would be more agile.
    ""In the first stage, we decided not only to lower the
reintegro but also to adopt a flexible policy of reintegro that
will allow private exporters to participate more actively in
Colombia's coffee export policy,"" he said.
    Traders said this means the export registration price will
change more often in a truer reflection of market trends.
    Gaviria said the measures merely responded to new market
factors since a return to a system of International Coffee
Organisation (ICO) export quotas may not occur in the short
term.
    ICO talks last month in London failed to break a deadlock
over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February
1986.
    Gaviria stressed that Colombia will not necessarily suffer
from depressed prices because it can compensate lower prices
with increased volume.
    ""Colombia will continue to export its traditional amount of
coffee, between 9.6 and 10 mln bags (of 60 kilos), and will do
so without an agreement among producers,"" he said.
    He ruled out a much higher volume of exports, or up to 13.5
mln bags as mentioned in market circles, ""because the idea is
precisely not to disrupt the market.""
    Colombia exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86
coffee year which ended last September 30.
    Echoing Gaviria's words, Jorge Cardenas, manager of the
national coffee growers' federation, said Colombia sought to
adapt its coffee marketing policy to circumstances.
    ""There is great expectation in the world for the policies
that Brazil and Colombia will adopt. Ours is beginning to
emerge and no agreement among producers is foreseeable in the
immediate future,"" he told journalists.
    Trade sources in Rio today said Brazil's future export
policy was unlikely to be revealed before the end of next week.
    Cardenas said a new ICO meeting could only take place when
problems that hindered an agreement at the recent London talks
have been resolved.
    Asked to comment on a Reuter report from Jakarta saying
Indonesia hoped Colombia could use its contacts with Brazil to
suggest a compromise on the quota issue, Cardenas said the
Brazilian stand was quite clear.
    He said Brazil's current quota ""reflects the reality of the
market, allows for an orderly supply and satisfies demand,"" but
added more clarity was needed to assess the criteria that
determined it.
    Cardenas said lows registered immediately after the failure
of the London talks were triggered by a widespread fear among
dealers of an imminent price war and the belief that producers
would go out and sell their coffee as quickly as possible,
which did not happen.

16292,SAUDI ARABIA LIBERALISES BANKING SYSTEM,"Saudi Arabia has speeded up reform of
its financial system with a package of measures designed to
boost the economy and open up the Kingdom to the lucrative
world of investment banking.
    Bankers in Saudi Arabia detect a fundamental shift in
policy stemming from a need to tackle the underlying
contradiction between an Islamic legal framework and western
banking system.
    One senior banker in Jeddah said: ""There is a new wind
blowing... Saudi Arabia is moving on many fronts in a manner
that is extraordinarily aggressive.""
    The speed of reform, begun last year but now gathering
pace, has surprised bankers who have had to contend with a
financial system that restricted internationalisation of the
riyal and a religious court system that made debt collecting
difficult.
    Saudi banks, once the most profitable in the world, have
generally reported falling profits for 1986 -- the fourth
successive year of decline -- as loan loss provisions ate into
already dwindling earnings.
    Bankers say the Saudi Finance Ministry and Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency (SAMA) seem to have developed a new strategy
although it remains to be seen how it will be implemented.
    Reform started in 1986 with measures to boost previously
dormant stock trading, but took off in earnest this year.
    -- From January 1, SAMA liberalised the money market,
giving banks greater access to liquidity aid via repurchase
agreements.
    -- From March 22, the Finance Ministry abolished
withholding tax on funds borrowed by Saudi banks abroad.
    -- From the same date, banks were notified of a new
committee to be set up under the auspices of SAMA to hear bank
disputes with creditors over non-payment of loans.
    -- Also from the same date, banks were allowed to use
mortgages as collateral for lending, banned since 1981.
    -- Within a few weeks, the Kingdom's first stock market
trading floor is expected to be opened.
    Housed in central Riyadh in the building of the Saudi
Industrial Development Fund, the floor will initially be used
to trade shares on an auction system. Staff from each of the 11
commercial banks have been trained ahead of the launch and a
new computer network has been set up.
    One banker said: ""The abolition of withholding tax will give
banks the opportunity to participate in new instruments such as
interest rate or currency swaps. At last SAMA and the Finance
Ministry are opening up markets for investment banking.""
    Bankers say Saudi authorities appear to have been shocked
into reform by pressure from banks and alarm at bank reluctance
to extend further loans to the private sector.
    Banks have lobbied hard for change, arguing that the
religious, or Sharia, legal framework was inconsistent with the
Kingdom's western banking system and made it nigh impossible
for them to collect interest on bad loans through the courts.
    As a result, many banks had virtually stopped new lending,
but found themselves cut off from world investment banking by a
series of restrictions. Withholding tax made it punitively
expensive to take part in interest rate or currency swaps.
    The private sector's frustration at the virtual standstill
in bank lending overflowed at a businessmen's conference in the
mountain resort in Abha last month and some powerful merchant
families also called for change, bankers said.
    ""Banks lobbied hard and had the ultimate weapon to force
change -- they stopped lending,"" another banker said. ""That was
stifling growth of the economy.""
    It is still unclear whether the new committee that will be
set up to hear bank disputes with creditors will prove any more
efficient than another non-Sharia system already in force, the
Committees for the Settlement of Commercial Disputes (CSCDs).
    Some bankers believe the new committee, yet to be formed,
will simply delay pending cases and force banks into a series
of private deals with creditors.
    Nor is it clear what stance the new committee will take on
interest payments, generally not recognised under Islamic law.
    But other bankers say the move is clear recognition by SAMA
and the Finance Ministry that Sharia courts and the CSCDs were
not the correct bodies for hearing bank disputes.
    Other reforms have been taken or are in the pipeline.
Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail said in March that a
new body would examine late government payments to contractors.
    In addition, further moves are under way to align business
life to the Gregorian calendar year, with companies being urged
to adopt it as their financial year.
    A black list of borrowers, started more than two years ago
by banks, has recently been effectively sanctioned by SAMA,
bankers say.
    Banks are now not permitted to lend or engage in securities
transactions with any party on the list.

1501,PS NEW MEXICO &lt;PNM> STUDIES SYSTEM PARTNERSHIP,"Public Service Co of New
Mexico said it is evaluating placing its electric distribution
system in a limited partnership with assets of about 400 mln
dlrs.
    The utility said it advised a customer task force this is
one restructuring alternative being considered for the
company's electric business.
    The structure is being evaluated as part of the company's
overall initiative in response to several goals announced by
New Mexico Governor Garrey Carruthers, it explained.
    Public Service New Mexico said a central feature of its
reorganization concept would be to separate the company's
electric utility operation into independent generation and
distribution entities, creating the opportunity for a targeted
35 mln dlr a year rate decrease.
    Noting the use of the limited partnership structure by a
variety of businesses recently, the company said it believes
""the concept may well have an application in the utility
business and intend to investigate it fully.""
    The generation company would provide projected power needs
of the distribution entity under a 30-year ""power security
agreement"" which would have a federally regulated rate
structure, the company said.
    Public Service New Mexico said the restructuring could
provide for its gas and water utilities and its non-utility
companies becoming subsidaries of the proposed holding company
approved by the company's shareholders in May 1986.
    This holding company would be the general partner of the
limited partnership, the company said.
    The company said its limited partnership concept was
presented to an ad hoc customer task force convened by Gov.
Carruthers to review the company's reorganization proposals.
    It said the reorganization and limited partnership are an
alternative structure that would  help reduce rates through a
lower overall cost of capital.
    Last month the governor said ""I have outlined to PNM
critical goals which I have asked them to cooperate with may
administration in achieving"" adding the goals include immediate
rate reduction, stabilization of future rates and stimulation
of business expansion.
    The company told the task force the new distribution
company, under the limited partnership alternative or
otherwise, would continue to be fully regulated by state
regulators.
    PNM's proposed generation company would continue to be
owned by common shareholders through the holding company. Its
rates would be set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
which regulates for wholesale electric power sales and
transmission services. The generation company would have no
retail customers.
    PNM said it expects to file a detailed restructuring plan
with state regulators in the near future, noting approval would
also be needed by FERC.

3484,JAPAN }O CURB VEHICLE EXPORTS TO EC,"Japanese car makers will curb their
exports to the European Community (EC) following an unofficial
directive from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
(MITI), automobile industry sources said.
    Some sources said exports to the EC this year are likely to
be at most unchanged from last year's 1.10 mln units and may
even fall due to an anticipated slackening of EC economic
growth and increasing trade friction.
    Last week, MITI vice minister for international affairs
Makoto Kuroda said the ministry had asked car makers to
exercise prudence in exporting to Europe.
    Japanese car makers boosted exports to the EC in January to
build up depleted vehicle inventories, industry sources said.
    Japan's vehicle exports to Europe in January rose 38 pct
from a year earlier to 174,133 units.
    In December, exports fell 70.4 pct year-on-year as makers
curbed shipments to meet an earlier directive from MITI to

11186,JAPANESE HESITATE TO INVEST IN WEST GERMAN STOCKS,"Japanese investors are reluctant to buy
West German stocks, now considered one of the most attractive
buys around after having taken a beating for the past two
years, investment managers said.
    Although the Frankfurt stock market is one of the world's
largest in capitalisation, wealthy Japanese institutions view
it as too small. They also worry about venturing into a market
from which British investors have recently bailed out, they
said.
    ""There's not enough turnover there to absorb the amount of
buying Japanese want to do,"" one West German investment manager
said. There is a danger Japanese institutions may be unable to
liquidate their holdings quickly if the market takes a sudden
downturn, he added.
    ""Japanese familiarity with West German stocks is also
limited,"" another investment manager said. ""They know the blue
chips, but there are too many other names they don't know.""
    The recent rapid advance of the Tokyo stock market has also
deterred Japanese from wandering off to markets abroad,
investment managers said.
    Japanese fund managers are afraid of criticism if they buy
into unsure overseas markets while the market at home continues
to advance, said Seiji Yamamoto, senior manager at Dresdner ABD
Securities Ltd's Tokyo branch.
    If gains from investments abroad lag behind those possible
from the Tokyo market, they could face difficulty explaining
their funds' performance, he added.
    The Frankfurt market's 15 pct depreciation just since the
beginning of this year has also been causing Japanese investors
to turn away, one investment manager said.
    The Frankfurt slump stems from expectations of slow
corporate growth due to the mark's strength against the dollar
and a withdrawal of funds by British institutions just before
the London market's liberalisation last year, the investment
manager said. ""Right now Japanese investors are taking a
wait-and-see attitude while the condition of the market remains
unfavourable,"" he said.
    Although there has been some nibbling of West German
stocks, particularly last week, most of the buys were for
short-term trades rather than long-term investments, an
investment advisor at a West German firm said.
    Investment managers believe, however, that genuine interest
in West German stocks could develop within the next three to
six months.
    Japanese fund managers still favour the New York and the
London markets over the Frankfurt market but they are
interested in diversifying some of their funds, they said.
    Some managers have been travelling in Europe, looking for
new opportunities, and are unlikely to ignore West German
stocks, especially with the average price/earnings ratio at
about 11, they said.
    The Frankfurt ratio compares with about 16 for the U.S. And
London markets and 52 for the Japanese market, Guenter
Kirchhain, first vice president for Deutsche Bank AG said.
    ""This mismatching will sooner or later generate an enormous
alignment potential,"" he said. The West German market could
reasonably have an average price/earnings ratio of around 16,
he added.
    Japanese investment plans may soon become clearer as many
institutions begin their new business years in April, he said.
    However, one fund manager does not agree that new
investment in West Germany will come that soon.
    ""Japanese do not buy into a market with declining
fundamentals,"" he said. When West Germany's fundamental economic
indicators appear to have bottomed out, that will be the
turning point for their investments, he added.
    Another manager said the Japanese are waiting to see the
investment trends set by U.S. And British investors in the West
German market.
    ""They are waiting for someone to make the first move,"" he
said.

15106,BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS,"Storage problems with Brazil's record
grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
problems.
    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
theoretically sufficient for the crop.
    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
capacity.
    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
storing loose grain, Brito said.
    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
crops.
    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
has been evident from television reports, which have shown
enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

17407,SEC OKAYS MIDWEST STOCK TRADING OF OTC ISSUES,"The Securities Exchange Commission
decided to allow the Midwest Stock exchange to trade 25 stocks
currently listed on the National Securities Dealers Association
Automated Quotation, NASDAQ, system.
    The SEC's unanimous decision granting so-called unlisted
trading privileges to the 25 NASDAQ securities will allow the
Midwest Exchange to begin trading the issues by May 18 under a
one-year pilot program.
    Unlisted trading privileges allow trading of stocks on an
exchange other than the one on which the stocks are listed.
    Before it would approve the Midwest Exchange request for
the unlisted trading privileges, the SEC had insisted that it
and the National Association of Securities Dealers, NASD, come
up with a way of reporting and combining information on stock
prices and transactions.
    SEC officials said they needed to be assured that 
information on the trading in and price of the securities would
be in one place, for accuracy and consistency.
    But since the exchanges still have not come with a master
plan, the SEC approved an interim plan under which NASDAQ
terminals would be put on the Midwest Exchange floor.
    All trades in the 25 over the counter securities done on
the Midewest Exchange will be quoted in the NASDAQ system as
well as on the Midwest Exchange under the interim plan.
    The NASD, Midwest Exchange and several other exchanges have
said they are working on a master plan for consolidating the
reporting of price quotes and other information on stocks now
traded on NASDAQ and listed on one or more exchanges.
    But an SEC official said such a new master reporting system
is not expected to be in place until early next year. The
Midwest Exchange proposed the interim reporting plan so that it
can begin unlisted trading immediately, he said.
    The 25 securities to be traded on the Midwest Exchange are
the first over the counter securities to be traded on any
exchange besides the NASDAQ. Some issues listed on exchanges,
however, are traded on the NASDAQ.
    The 25 securities had an average dollar volume last year of
2.4 billion dlrs and made up 18 pct of the dollar volume of all
the securities quoted on the NASD's National Market System.
    SEC officials said they would review the pilot program in
about a year. It was intended to spur more competition in the
securities industry.

of the one billion dlrs would go towards rehabilitating

    ""No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas,
floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while a
national dialogue on the issue continues,"" DiBona said at a

    DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on
how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on
removing several government policies that hinder investments in
new prospects.
    DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished
immediately and current proposals for increased environmental
regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not
adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil
companies, DiBona said.
    ""This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the
nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil,"" DiBona

consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported

14840,INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND,"The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is
likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and
possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian
Nainggolan said.
    He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in
palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.
    Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil
may also be introduced. But he said the question was still
being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no
decision on when to go ahead had been made.
    The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber
physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.
    ""Several factors make us move cautiously,"" Nainggolan said.
""We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a
mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.""
    Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee
added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to
five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are
traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,
exchange officials said.
    The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the
introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one
official said a feasibility study was needed first. No
decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April
23, traders said.
    Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the
world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should
expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of
the exchange would help this.
    Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost
overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.
    He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to
encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would
also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to
encourage participation.
    Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start
although trading in coffee has been disappointing.
    Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in
April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9
mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered
locally, the latest exchange report said.
     Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905
tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.

economy and other rights of both countries.
    ""As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be

    The two countries approached armed confrontation last month
after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the

system, Europe's biggest personal payments system, grew by 11
pct to 39.1 mln last year and is expected to continue
increasing by around 10 pct in coming years, Eurocheque
International Secretary General Mark Van Wauve said.
    He told a news conference Eurocheque cards can now be used
in 40 European and Mediterranean countries to back Eurocheques
written in local currency and, where facilities are available,
as electronic debit cards. The system would have 5,000
automatic cash dispensers by the end of this year and aimed to
have 25,000 throughout Europe by 1992.
    Eurocheques and cards are issued by banks in 21 countries.
    Van Wauve said Italian banks, who already accept
Eurocheques, had recently asked to be allowed also to issue
Eurocheques and cards to their clients. It was possible these
would be launched in Italy this year if the Rome government
agreed to lift exchange controls that prevent residents writing
cheques abroad in any currency but lira, he told Reuters.
    Eurocheque International, the system's Brussels-based
coordinating centre, was also reviewing a request from the
Soviet Union for permission to issue cheques and cards.
    Eurocheque's agreements with banks do not permit them to
charge commissions from clients using Eurocheques, and Van
Wauwe said problems with French banks that have demanded such
commissions had been reduced to a minimum last year.
    Eurocheques can also be used to pay in local currency for
goods and services bought in over five mln retail outlets in 28
countries, with Hungary, Tunisia and Greece added to the system
this year. East Germany last year became the 40th country to
accept Eurocheques, made out in dollars, at banks and shops.
    Eurocheque International estimated the total of Eurocheques

filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is

opinions are divided on the impact to the market.
    ""The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today,"" said
one trader. ""Everyone is talking about it, assessing their
company's situations in relation to Texaco,"" he added.
     Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are
concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies
under the bankruptcy filing.
    However, others were less worried. ""The first paid will be
the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the
shipping industry,"" one New York trader said.
    ""If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its
refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,""

interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.

toward prudence in their dealings with the company.
    Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or
letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco
on an open line basis, he said.
    Another trader, however, described today's activity as
business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because
no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in
bankruptcy.
    Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco
filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange
might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins
for Texaco's trades.
    New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden
declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is
is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as
a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower
allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for

Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make
payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have

    Ecuador yesterday said last week's earthquake was forcing
it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in

banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign
debt.
    ""All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,"" the
president said during a visit to the quake zone. ""A government
as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain.""
    He said he had previously held that Ecuador was obliged to
make debt payments when crude oil was at 26 dlrs a barrel
because the government had projected plans with crude prices at
that level.
    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil
would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able
to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.

dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs

382,U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - ASSET-BACK MARKET GROWS,"The U.S. asset-backed debt securities
market, which grew explosively last year, is broadening and
investment bankers say 1987 could see a variety of issuers.
    ""It is interesting to note that the first two asset-backed
deals of the year were done by commercial banks,"" said Anthony
Dub, who heads First Boston Corp's asset-backed group.
    BankAmerica Corp's &lt;BAC> Bank of America unit last week
issued 400 mln dlrs of securities backed by credit card
receivables via sole manager First Boston. Dub said the
offering sold out quickly, mostly to institutional investors.
    The Bank of America offering followed a January 16 issue of
200 mln dlrs of similar debt by RepublicBank Corp's &lt;RPT>
RepublicBank Delaware unit. Goldman, Sachs and Co ran the books
on that deal, with First Boston acting as co-manager.
    However, Dub said the Bank of America securities were more
closely related to the so-called ""cars deals"" that raced to
market last year than were the RepublicBank securities.
    ""The RepublicBank issue was secured by credit card
receivables. In contrast, the Bank of America deal was the
first public offering of credit card receivables because we
used a grantor trust vehicle,"" he said.
    In a grantor trust, investors buy asset-backed certificates
that represent a specified percentage of an undivided interest
in the trust, analysts explained.
    The Bank of America certificates were issued by California
Credit Card Trust A, which the bank established for that single
purpose, investment bankers pointed out.
    The debt has an average life of 1.79 years and matures in
1992. First Boston gave the issue a 6.90 pct coupon and priced
it at 99.8125 to yield 6.95 pct, or 65 basis points over
comparable Treasury securities. Non-callable for life, the deal
was rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
    Underwriters away from the syndicate said they believed the
Bank of America deal was priced too aggressively. ""AAA-rated
auto paper was trading about 75 basis points over Treasuries
when First Boston priced the deal,"" one said.
    However, Dub said the offering sold out quickly anyway.
    The First Boston executive attributed this to the deal's
top-flight rating by both agencies, unlike many of last year's
cars deals, which were rated by S and P alone.
    ""Investors receive interest only payments for the first 18
months and then interest and principal payments for the
remaining five to seven months,"" Dub detailed.
    Investment bankers pointed out that because the Bank of
America deal did not pay principal for a year and a half, the
issue had a longer average life than some of the cars deals
that were brought to market late last year.
    The collateral for the trust includes a pool of VISA credit
card receivables, backed by a letter of credit. Bank of America
has about four billion dlrs of credit card receivables, making
it one of the biggest in the U.S., analysts said.
    Last week's deal was Bank of America's second foray into
the young asset-backed securities market, analysts noted.
    In mid-December 1986 Bank of America sold, via California
Cars Grantor Trust 1986-A, 514 mln dlrs of certificates backed
by automobile receivables through Salomon Brothers Inc.
    Upcoming asset-backed issues include 200 mln dlrs of notes
backed by the car leases of Volvo 1986 Lease Finance Corp, a
unit of Volvo Finance North America Inc, via First Boston, and
450 mln dlrs of notes secured by sales contracts of Mack Trucks
Receivables Corp, a unit of Mack Trucks Inc &lt;MACK>, via
Shearson Lehmand Brothers Inc.
    The asset backed market, which began in March 1985, totals
an estimated 11.9 billion dlrs.

4872,SWISS WARY OF U.S.-BRITISH BANK SUPERVISION PACT,"Markus Lusser, vice-president of the
Swiss National Bank, said he was sceptical of the recent
U.S.-British accord on joint bank supervision, fearing smaller
countries could be forced to cooperate.
    In a speech prepared for delivery to a meeting of West
German savings banks, he said such an accord would cover the
three most important financial centres of the world if extended
to Japan as planned.
    ""Countries not prepared to cooperate with an agreement of
the group of three could easily be put under pressure,"" Lusser
said.
    ""It would be enough to forbid banks the right to make use of
those financial markets or to place them under a special
status,"" he added.
    Banks which operate worldwide could scarcely afford to stay
away from these centres and would place their national
governments under pressure to conform.
    Lusser added that he was opposed to the form, though not
the content of the accord. Switzerland itself was not affected,
since capital adequacy requirements here were already stricter
than in Britain or the United States. But he feared such
accords might be substituted for internationally negotiated

11330,U.S. SUGARBEET PLANTINGS SEEN RISING IN 1987,"Representatives of U.S. sugar grower
organizations said they expect some increase the area planted
to sugarbeets this year and said the prospects for the 1987
cane sugar crop also are good.
    Dave Carter, president of the U.S. beet sugar association,
said plantings may be up in two major beet growing states,
California and Michigan, while sowings could be down slightly
in the largest producing state of Minnesota.
    Overall, Carter predicted beet plantings would rise in the
midwest, and this coupled with increases in California would
increase U.S. sugarbeet plantings slightly from the 1.232 mln
acres sown last year.
    USDA later today releases its first estimate of 1987 U.S.
sugarbeet plantings in the prospective plantings report.
    The main reason for the expected increase in beet sowings
is that returns from competing crops such as soybeans and
grains are ""just awful,"" said Carter.
    In the midwest, bankers are strongly encouraging farmers to
plant sugarbeets because the U.S. sugar program offers a loan
rate of 18 cents per pound and because payments to farmers from
beet processors are spread evenly over the growing season, said
Luther Markwart, executive vice president of the American
sugarbeet growers association.
    ""The banks are putting a lot of pressure on these guys,""
Markwart said.
    In some areas there are waiting lists of farmers seeking a
contract with processors to plant beets, Markwart said.
    USDA's report today will not include any harvested area
estimates for sugarcane, but representatives of Florida, Hawaii
and Louisiana growers said crop prospects are good.
    Horis Godfrey, a consultant representing Florida and Texas
cane growers, said Florida cane is off to a good start  because
for the first time in several years there was no winter freeze.
Although area to be harvesteed is about the same as last year,
cane production may be up in Florida this year, he said.
    In Hawaii, area harvested may decline slightly this year,
but likely will be offset again in 1987 by increased yields,
said Eiler Ravnholt, vice president of the Hawaiian Sugar
Planters Association.
    The acreage planted to sugarbeets will receive more than
the usual amount of attention this year because of mounting
concern that continued increases in domestic sugar production
threaten the U.S. sugar program, industry sources said.
    The increases in beet plantings have especially caused
concern among cane growers who have not expanded plantings,
particularly in Hawaii, industry officials said.
    ""We haven't had a good weather year throughout the beet and
cane areas in more than five years,"" said Godfrey, adding that
the U.S. may be due for a good weather year.
    Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., chairman of the House
agriculture subcommittee responsible for the sugar program, has
threatened to offer legislation next year to curb domestic
sweetener output if growers fail to restrain output in 1987.

    The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificate

    A National Bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would

interbank interest rates.
    The spokesman said it was too early to predict whether the
move would herald a reduction in discount rate, which currently
stands at eight pct, when the Bank holds its regular weekly

    The discount rate generally moves in tandem with the

3798,ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS,"Lured by the weakening dollar and the
conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European
energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves
to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.
    They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable
United States is good insurance against future shortages.
However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up
competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.
institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice
domestic oil properties.
    Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and
gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers
had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All
buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a
barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for
acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five
dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.
    ""Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but
we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,"" said
Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and
president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.
    ""Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and
gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,"" he added.
    Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe
the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because
of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that
oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to
buy new reserves than to explore for them.
    Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to
the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and
general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.
    In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,
French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of &lt;Total Compagnie
Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to
separately acquire oil assets of Texas International &lt;TEICC>
and Lear Petroleum Partners &lt;LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome
said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.
    A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, &lt;Petrofina S.A.>
and &lt;Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy
virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos &lt;WMB>,
the Oklahoma pipeline firm.
    But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures
with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's
&lt;Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's &lt;TX> Texaco USA in a
100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with
Dupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.
    Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its
geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are
more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions
than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.
    Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing
International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of &lt;Preussag
Corp> and &lt;C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had
earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in
Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.
    But he called that a small amount compared to the amount
other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne
Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up
to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.
    ""The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign
investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil
companies,"" he said. ""Our company is shopping around because we
feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If
you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need
prices higher than the current market,"" he added.
    In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage
houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also
competing for prime properties.
    Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group
&lt;RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and
selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired
two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of
oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.
    ""Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these
companies,"" Smith said. ""Domestic production has dropped by one
mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may
drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988.""

10247,U.S. FARM CREDIT PROBLEMS SOLVABLE -BOARD MEMBER,"Substantial difficulties faced by the
U.S. farm credit system can be solved with a business-like
approach to the problems, a Farm Credit Admimistration official
said.
    Marvin R. Duncan, a member of the administration board,
said the farm credit system faces unprecedented difficulties in
its 70-year history.
    Addressing Chicago business and agricultural economists,
Duncan outlined three basic problems of the farm credit system.
Those include the high cost of its debt, the quality of its
assets, and the management of its credit delivery system.
    He said some of the system's debt carries interest rates as
high as 15.65 pct and will not mature until the year 2007.
    Of its 54.6 mln dlrs in assets, 24.1 pct are non-accrual,
high risk or already forfeited property, which led to losses in
1986 of 1.9 billion dlrs and in 1985 of 2.7 billion dlrs.
    Problems with credit delivery have been somewhat resolved,
he said.
    ""The system is still plagued with duplication in layers of
management and decision-making, inadequate tailoring of credit
services to fit the emerging market, a large investment in
bricks and mortar, and a management and directorate more
insular to the marketplace than that of its competitors,"" he
said.
    He said solutions to the problems should -
 - provide assurances to farmers on borrowers stock and the
stability of the farm credit system.
 - maintain confidence of investors who buy system securities.
 - address the high cost of the system's existing debt.
 - enable the Farm Credit System Capital Corporation to carry
out its role as a workout bank.
    Frank Naylor, chairman of the Farm Credit Administration,
said this week that the system may lose as much as 1.4 billion
dlrs this year, and another board member, Jim Billington, said
Congress should plan to spend at least 800 mln dlrs beginning
late this year to bail out the system.
    Duncan noted that the system has about 70 billion dlrs in
assets, serves about 800,000 individual borrowers and 3,000
cooperatives, and has 62.5 billion dlrs in securities
outstanding.
    ""With a business-like solution to its problems, it can
continue that role for generations into the future,"" he said.

said a further yen rise would have adverse effects on the
Japanese economy.
    He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will
continue to take adequate measures, including market
intervention, to stabilize exchange rates if necessary, in
close cooperation with other major industrialized nations. He
said the current instability of exchange rates will not last.
    Six major nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the
U.S. And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to act
together to hold currencies stable.
    Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue
adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic
and financial developments in and outside Japan.
    He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February
20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions
had already been sufficiently eased.
    To prevent a resurgence of inflation, the Bank will take a
very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy
credit conditions, he said.
    He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct should
stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand.
    Commenting on the dollar's fall below 150 yen, Sumita
reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the
currency's weakness.
    The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting

19588,INTERNATIONAL SPOT OIL PRICES FIRM ON OPEC ACCORD,"OPEC's weekend decision to cut planned
oil output levels for second half 1987 has renewed market
confidence in the oil price outlook for the rest of the year
and boosted international spot prices, oil traders said.
    Spot crude prices are now standing 80-85 cents a barrel
higher than at the start of the OPEC meeting last Thursday and
could continue their rise in the next few weeks, they said.
    The new optimism springs from the agreement reached by OPEC
ministers in Vienna on Saturday to fix a July-December output
ceiling of 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd).
    At its previous meeting in December, OPEC set a provisional
16.6 mln bpd output limit for the third quarter but proposed a
sharp rise to 18.3 mln in the fourth. The ceilings were to back
up its newly restored fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
    When signs first emerged last Friday that OPEC was
contemplating cutting the planned fourth quarter ceiling, spot
prices of the most widely traded crude oil, Britain's Brent
Blend, surged 30-40 cents a barrel.
    Traders said the trend continued in a cautious rally this
morning in London, taking quoted levels up to around 19.25/35
dlrs, compared with 18.45/50 dlrs in the middle of last week.
    Most traders on international oil markets reacted bullishly
to news of the final agreement. They forecast tight supplies
later in the year, when demand for oil increases with the onset
of the Northern Hemisphere winter, and further rises in spot
prices.
    ""There will be a scramble for oil in the third and fourth
quarters of this year"" one trader said. ""In the past three months
we have already seen a rise in demand, particularly from the
U.S., And I expect to see even higher prices"" he added.
    Mehdi Varzi, analyst with stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson
in London, agreed.
    Varzi told Reuters that OPEC was if anything too cautious
in setting the new output ceilings. ""There is now a great chance
that Brent crude oil will hit 20 dlrs a barrel in the next
month,"" he said.
    Laurie Law, analyst at E.F. Hutton and Co Inc in New York,
said over the weekend that she saw the spot price of West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) rallying to around 22 dlrs by the end of the
year from just over 20 dlrs now.
    WTI, the U.S. Benchmark crude, usually fetches a premium of
80 cents to one dlr over Brent. So far this year, spot Brent
has held mostly between 18 and 19 dlrs a barrel.
    But some traders, fearing continued over-production by some
OPEC members, sounded a note of caution over the new accord.
    Iraq has again refused to be a party to the agreement
because other OPEC ministers turned down its repeated demand
for the same production quota as its Gulf War enemy Iraq.
    In recent months Iraq has been producing 500,000 bpd above
its assigned quota, and it could begin pumping a further
500,000 bpd when a new export pipeline comes on stream in
September.
    According to Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa
al-Sabah, actual OPEC production in the fourth quarter could be
well above the official ceiling at nearly 18 mln bpd.

17771,MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS,"Flooding in the Red River on the
Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
    ""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a company
source said.
    The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
    Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
oil which has been lost to the flood.
    ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.""
    The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's
operator.
     Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
    July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
    Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
    Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
barrel below WTI, respectively.
    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
    He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
apparently washed away.
   
    The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
line.
    Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
which is nearby.

8618,WILLIAMS HOLDINGS BIDS 542.2 MLN STG FOR NORCROS,"Industrial holding company Williams
Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary
shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc.
    The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams
shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share
    Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last
night of 397p.
    A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits
of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to
propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash
alternative.
    The offer will include a partial convertible alternative
under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69
mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their
ordinary share allocations.
    The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one
Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a
value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.
    Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986
rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.
    Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in
the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it
centred on &lt;Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then
switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.
    Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with
Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which
replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also
result from normal trading.
    In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise
in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover
that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln
    Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a
market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of
acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its
capitalisation up to around 380 mln.
    The convertible offer would be on the basis of four
Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a
share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of
400.2p a share.
    The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price
down to 733p from last night's close at 750p.
    Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or
0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.
    There was no immediate response from Norcros.

3438,RUBBER LEAF DISEASE SEEN AFFECTING SUPPLY/PRICES,"The leaf disease corenes pora,
which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and
Indonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push up
depressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said.
    Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved
and must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protection
and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of
Malaysia (RRIM), told Reuters.
    He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes
pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may cause
output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.
    The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute
may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the
disease and added that most estates affected belong to the
State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.
    Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects
certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that
further use of such clones must be discontinued.
    Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research
Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444,
2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said.
    Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725
clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed
after use of such clones were discontinued.
    Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also
affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience
has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added.
    ""The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is not
curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may
drop and prices can rise,"" he said.
    He added that the RRIM was aware of the disease outbreak in

4495,FCC PANEL RECOMMENDS PHONE FEE HIKE,"A Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) board recommended raising the two-dollar monthly
subscriber line charge for residential telephone customers by
1.50 dlrs over the next two years.
    The subscriber line charge was first levied by the FCC in
June, 1985, in an effort to more acurately reflect the cost of
providing phone service as a part of phone deregulation.
    The recommendation by the board, composed of federal and
state utility regulators, was expected to be approved by the
FCC in a seperate decision in the next few weeks.
    The subscriber line charge for residences and businesses
with single phone lines will rise to 2.60 dlrs in June 1987,
3.20 in September 1988, and 3.50 dlrs in April 1989.
    The staff of the FCC said at a public meeting that the
increase in the charge would make possible a reduction in
long-distance phone rates of 15 pct or 17 billion dlrs over six
years.
    Supporters of the subscriber line charge have argued that
long distance phone rates had been subsidizing local phone
service, which would lead to abandonment of the phone network
by large commercial phone customers.

urged the Government to prepare drastic pump-priming measures
even at the cost of shelving Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's
planned tax reforms, officials involved said.
    Officials of the Federation of Economic Organisations
(Keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the
Government should issue construction bonds as an emergency
measure to prop up the economy.
    Keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in
the newly-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp should
also be used to stimulate the economy.
    Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito said the dollar's fall
below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies
that could shake the foundation of the Japanese economy.
    The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for
drastic reflationary measures sent to the Government by the
Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
    Both organisations called for stepped-up Bank of Japan
intervention to stabilise exchange rates.
    Chamber head Noboru Gotoh told a press conference the
awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up
Japan's Gross National Product (GNP) by about two pct.
    Gotoh said the Government could cope with the present
critical economic condition even if it put off its plan to stop
the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    The plan to reduce the fiscal budget is a pillar of
Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction program.

18532,JAPAN INSTITUTIONS EYEING T-BOND INVESTMENT WARILY,"Some major Japanese institutional
investors are gradually returning to investing in U.S.
Treasuries, although fear that the dollar has not yet bottomed
out has kept others cautiously waiting on the sidelines.
    Trust banks and some investment trusts are starting to look
at buying treasuries for short-term gains, while other
investment trusts and most life insurers are still wary,
according to fund managers polled by Reuters.
    The five percentage point gap between U.S. And Japanese
long-term bonds is the major attraction of T-bonds.
    Most institutions remain sensitive to the prospects of
dollar declines, after making huge foreign exchange losses on
their foreign bond holdings last fiscal year ended March.
    The seven leading local life insurers alone saw losses on
their foreign bond holdings of over 1,700 billion yen, or some
11.5 billion dlrs, in 1986/87, industry sources said.
    However, most institutional investors want to buy U.S.
T-bonds due to the absence of profitable domestic instruments.
    ""Despite all the negative factors, we have definite demand
for U.S. Securities,"" said Osamu Fukushima, deputy manager of
Mitsui Trust and Banking Co Ltd's securities department.
    Another trust bank fund manager said, ""What matters the most
are the fundamentals of the U.S. Economy and the
competitiveness of U.S. Industry. We are closely watching the
growth of U.S. Exports, which is an important measure of the
fundamental strength of the dollar."" The U.S. Trade deficit's
decline in April was due to a 1.2 billion dlr decline in
imports, while exports did not show a recovery, he said.
    One life insurance company fund manager said, ""We doubt the
U.S. Government will fight the trade and fiscal deficits,
especially after the announcement of Federal Reserve Board
chairman Paul Volcker's resignation.""
    ""The receptive stance of the U.S. Congress on the call for
further dollar falls to cut the country's trade deficit also
makes us wary about U.S. Bonds purchases,"" the life insurance
company fund manager said.
    Yuji Miyaji, deputy manager of the Sumitomo Trust and
Banking Co Ltd's securities investment department, said, ""We are
slowly starting to buy U.S. Bonds because the gap of over 500
basis points between the U.S. And Japan is very attractive
However, we are pessimistic on the dollar's further recovery.
We find that U.S. Economic fundamentals have not changed so
far.""
    Keijirou Fukushima, manager at Yamaichi Investment Trust
Management Co Ltd's bond portfolio management department, said,
""We would like to invest in U.S. Bonds gradually, given an
improved inflation outlook and the limited chances of a further
steep fall in the dollar from now.""
    ""We have already reduced forward dollar selling volume to 40
pct of our total foreign assets from 60 pct,"" he said.
    Another life insurance company fund manager said, ""We have
started investing in U.S. Treasury securities, but only on a
trading basis.""

12013,YUGOSLAVIA WINS TIME IN PARIS CLUB REFINANCING,"Yugoslavia has won breathing space from
its major official creditors through yesterday's Paris Club
refinancing agreement but it will take time for it to resolve
its economic crisis, economists at western embassies said.
    Yugoslav delegation chief Finance Minister Svetozar
Rikanovic said a refinancing was agreed for 475 mln dlrs of
debt falling due between May 16 this year and May 31, 1988.
    The agreement was the second multi-year Yugoslav debt
refinancing, based on a protocol signed last May which ushered
in ""enhanced monitoring"" of Yugoslavia's economy by the IMF.
    Western economists who follow Yugoslav financial affairs
said a similar deal would probably emerge from talks with
commercial creditors at the end of this month. But they said
the refinancings would only provide a breathing space, because
Yugoslavia has to repay 5.5 billion dlrs in 1987.
    And the country is still struggling to reverse a dramatic
decline in export earnings, which have fallen 12.5 pct so far
this year, continuing a downward spiral of the past 18 months.
    The Yugoslav hard currency debt has grown from 1.2 billion
dlrs in 1965 to stand at 19.7 billion dlrs at the end of 1986
and is one of the country's most dire economic problems.
    The debt began to snowball in the 1960s and 1970s due to an
excessive investment rate exceeding the growth of the Gross
Social Product and necessitating additional foreign borrowing.
    Rising international oil prices in the 1970s proved to be a
serious blow to the country's balance of payments.
    Deputy Prime Minister Milos Milosavljevic said this month
that Yugoslavia had repaid 640 mln dlrs of principal and 325
mln dlrs of interest so far this year.
    According to official Yugoslav figures, Yugoslavia repaid a
record 5.97 billion dlrs in capital and interest in 1986,
reducing overall indebtedness by 996 mln dlrs.
    Mikulic is trying to rein in rampant retail inflation of
almost 100 pct a year through price and incomes controls.
    Janez Zemljaric, also a Deputy Prime Minister, said
recently Yugoslavia expected a ""definite measure of
understanding"" from its 16 major western creditor nations.
    Western economists said Yugoslavia has had its way with the
Paris Club creditors but that not all creditors were satisfied
with its economic performance last year. They said the Paris
discussions were heated and emotional.
    ""Economic factors were balanced by political realities,"" an
economist at one of the main embassies here said, but added
that creditors had no complaints regarding Yugoslavia's
repayment record because it had so far always repaid debts on
time.
    Yugoslavia has refinanced its debt regularly since 1983.
    In December 1985, it signed a deal with the International
Coordinating Committee of 600 commercial banks to refinance
maturities arising between January 1, 1985 and end-1988.
    It had signed bilateral refinancing agreements in March of
that year for maturities arising from January 1, 1985 to March
25, 1986, following an agreement in Paris on March 25, 1985.
    Government ministers told Reuters this month that
Yugoslavia had made too great an effort to repay its debts in
1986, at great cost to the economy, and that this was
regretted.
    Mikulic has said Yugoslavia is unlikely to follow Brazil's
lead and suspend its debt repayments ""but we have understanding
for what that country did.""
    Western economists said, however, that Mikulic's remarks,
taken with those of his ministers, could be a signal that some
problems were seen ahead in refinancing debt repayments.
    Before the Paris talks, some Yugoslav officials had hinted
that Yugoslavia could start to look to the Soviet Bloc for
financial support if Belgrade failed to secure the necessary
refinancing from western creditors.
    Sources close to the western creditors, however, said they
did not view the threat as serious.

    The company will not set up its own dealer franchises, but
intends to work through distributors who will wholesale the
vehicles to a franchised dealer organisation.
    Lutz commented, ""We prefer to export to Europe rather than
manufacture here because it will allow us to take full

1987 and July 17, 1987 the total amount outstanding of two
Swiss franc public issues, in the first of what could be a
series of similar moves in other capital markets, a spokesman
for the Bank said in a telephone call from Washington.
    The prepayments cover 96 mln Swiss francs of 6-1/2 pct
Swiss franc bonds of 1976 and due 1991, lead managed by Swiss
Bank Corporation and 100 mln Swiss francs of 7-3/8 pct bonds of
1981 and due 1991, lead managed by Credit Suisse.
    Eugene Rotberg, World Bank vice president-treasurer, said
in a prepared statement that the prepayments are being made
because of the substantial decline in interest rates over the
past two years, the spokesman said.
    The World Bank intends to exercise early redemption on
selected public issues of its securities in Switzerland and
other capital markets if the exercise is financially beneficial
and consistent with the Bank's overall funding strategy.
    Last month, Rotberg said that the World Bank planned to
bring forward to the first half of 1987 its borrowing plans for

11231,"CSR SELLS OIL/GAS INTERESTS, BIDS TO EXTEND SUGAR","CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling
its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and
ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share
analysts said.
    CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas
interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead
sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production
Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs.
    In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest
sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it
does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd.
    A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and
300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had given
itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an
ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions
of sugar and building products, analysts said.
    The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the
largest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry
and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in
the country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend
acceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from the
bottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.

5473,ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION,"&lt;Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move unique
among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global
expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its
yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.
    First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst
Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is
attainable. But it ""will be a tremendous achievement because
... they're going to have to build an international earnings
base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic
trust companies,"" Walsh said.
    Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's
154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth
this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company
profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview.
    He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26
pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.
    Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with
assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated
internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.
    Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when
other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and
loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.
    The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened
domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank
operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,
Cornelissen said.
    Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and
Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical
Co &lt;DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset
management, merchant and private banking companies.
    ""It was a heaven-sent opportunity,"" Cornelissen said of the
Dow Financial acquisition. ""We achieved in one year what would
otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.""
    Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct
competition with major global financial institutions in
activities such as international lending and stock brokerage,
in order to exploit ""profitable niches"" overseas in traditional
trust activities such as asset management, private banking and
advisory services.
    He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations
""before the end of this month"" to sell its London-based Savory
Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.
    ""The international market is so big and we have such a
miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really
limited only by our energy and our desire to find more
business,"" he said, adding that in trust-type services, ""we
don't think the international markets are well-served.""
    Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign 
investment interest in North America and increased Canadian
investment abroad, Cornelissen said.
    Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid
economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said
Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion
dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.
    Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia
will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of
global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, ""We knew we had
to be there."" Royal Trust's 14 international locations include
offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also
recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
    The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing
growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any
acquisitions in the ""immediate future,"" although ""we have our
eyes wide open for the right opportunities.""
    Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the
company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,
Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well
covered by hundreds of small regional banks.
    ""That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,""
said Cornelissen. ""That is probably one area that we will
probably do something with in the next five years.""
    He said the company would continue to emphasize its home
Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services
analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.
    Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,
trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in
one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition
for Royal Trust, ""but not drastically more,"" Cornelissen said.

19986,JAPAN UNEMPLOYMENT RISES TO RECORD 3.2 PCT IN MAY,"Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate rose to a record 3.2 pct in May, the worst level since the
government started compiling unemployment statistics in 1953,
the government's Management and Coodination Agency said.
    The May rate surpassed the previous record of 3.0 pct
marked set in January and April this year. It was also up
sharply from 2.7 pct a year earlier.
    Unadjusted May unemployment totalled 1.91 mln people, up
from 1.90 mln in April and 1.62 mln a year earlier.
    An agency official blamed industrial restructuring and the
strong yen for the rise in unemployment.
    The seasonally adjusted male unemployment rate in May rose
to a record 3.2 pct, surpassing the previous record 3.0 pct set
in July 1986. This compares with 2.9 pct in April and 2.7 pct a
year earlie. Unadjusted male unemployment totalled 1.12 mln, up
180,000 from a year earlier.
    The female unemployment rate in May was unchanged from
April at a record 3.1 pct. A year ago, the rate was 2.8 pct.
Unadjusted female unemployment rose 100,000 to 790,000.
    The yen's appreciation continued to affect employment in
manufacturing industries and the total employed in May fell
210,000 or 1.5 pct from a year earlier to 14.10 mln.

3366,TOP U.S. OFFICIAL SEES DELAY IN BANK REFORM,"A top Treasury official said he does
not expect any comprehensive Congressional reform of the U.S.
banking industry until after the 1988 presidential election due
to political pressures and, to a lesser extent, the insider
trading scandal on Wall Street.
    George Gould, Under Secretary of the Treasury, told a Wall
Street Planning Group luncheon, ""legislation is not going to
happen before the election ... (people) do not like to vote on
controversial issues in election years.""
    ""It may take a while in the next administration ... to get
something done,"" he added.
    Calls for a major overhaul of the U.S. banking industry,
which would probably feature wider investment banking powers
for commercial banks, has met strong opposition from private
interest groups, such as the Securities Industry Association.
    ""These discussions have nothing to do with merit ... these
groups are trying to cloak self-interest in public policy
terms,"" Gould said. ""It is easier to stop something than it is
to get it going.""
    He also described current concern about insider trading as
""a major impediment to further progress ... it is not a helpful
backdrop to accomplish financial reform.""
    Similarly, Gould said lobbying by such groups as the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions would probably mean that the
Reagan Administration's proposal for the recapitalization of
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp would be watered
down.
    Gould foresaw a five billion dlr injection over two years,
compared with the original request for 15 billion dlrs over
three years.
    Gould ruled out any new government initiative on banking
reform but said that some broad guidelines to address these
issues would be made public over the next few months.

136,GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH,"A study on grain certificates due out
shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show
that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than
cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.
    Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture
Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests
that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official
told Reuters.
    GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific
request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the
senate agriculture committee.
    The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates
compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.
    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on
the program's impact on the USDA loan program.
    If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan
entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of
the program would go up. However, if it is determined that
certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to
decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.
    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates
program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.
    But a negative report on certificates ""will fuel the fire
against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase
in the certificate program,"" an agricultural consultant said.
    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,
while USDA remains firmly committed to it.

16199,TWO UTAH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FAIL,"Two Utah financial institutions, the
Bank of Iron County and Summit Savings and Loan Association,
have failed, official spokesmen said.
    The board of directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) has approved the assumption of the deposit
liabilities of Bank of Iron County, Parowan, Utah, by Dixie
State Bank, St George, Utah, an FDIC spokesman said.
    The bank, which had total assets of 20.1 mln dlrs, was the
first bank in Utah to fail this year and the 59th nationwide.
    Its three offices will reopen today as branches of Dixie
State Bank and its depositors will automatically become
depositors of the assuming bank.
    Dixie State Bank will assume about 19.9 mln dlrs in 6,300
deposit accounts and will purchase all of the failed bank's
assets at a discount of 3.575 mln dlrs.
    The Federal Home Loan Bank Board closed Summit Savings and
Loan Association, Park City, Utah, and directed the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) to transfer an
estimated 116.9 mln dlrs in insured deposits to United Savings
and Loan Association, Ogden, Utah, an FSLIC spokesman said.
    Summit, a 120.8 mln dlr institution, was insolvent, the
spokesman said. The bank board appointed the FSLIC as
conservator for the association on April 14, 1986.
    Summit has since operated as part of the bank board's
Management Consignment Program. United Savings has 205 mln dlrs
in assets and nine offices in Utah, and one in Idaho.

5192,(CORRECTED)-IVORY COAST CONFIRMS PRESENCE AT TALKS,"A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture
Ministry official confirmed his country's backing for a new
international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be
present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week.
    The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister
Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened
by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on
Monday.
    While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral
ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country's capital
Yamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will
be present throughout the London talks, the official said.
    Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that
he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public
mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low
world cocoa prices Friday.
    The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new
pact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the
world's cocoa exporters and consumers.
    He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO
Council chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March
27.
    The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the
pact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market
hit by successive world cocoa surpluses.
    Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international
cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked
hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices.

8963,MEXICO SEES COMPROMISE ON IADB REFORMS,"There is a good chance that the United
States and Latin America will agree reforms in the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) as a result of talks
yesterday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Mexican
Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said.
    ""This is a complex issue, but I am very optimistic on an
agreement, he told reporters during the IADB's annual meeting
here.
    The U.S., which holds a 34.5 pct stake in the Bank, has
proposed lowering the veto power to 35 pct, a move strongly
opposed by Latin countries which together hold 54.2 pct.
    Petricioli said he saw the basis for a compromise when the
issue comes up again during the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank interim meetings next month in Washington.
    He said Baker had indicated receptivity to Latin America's
position during talks yesterday with the so-called ""A""
countries - Brazil, Argentina and Mexico - who stand to suffer
a net deficit of IADB funding unless the Bank votes a
substantial capital increase.
    Proposals are on the table for a seventh replenishment of
funds totalling 20 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90, plus
2.9 billion carried over from the sixth replenishment.
    But Washington has previously said it would not agree to a
nine billion dlr increase in its subscription unless reforms
were agreed, a position described today by Nicaragua's Central
Bank governor Joaquin Cuadra Chamorro as undemocratic.
    Petricioli nevertheless said Baker showed ""flexibility in
being prepared to accommodate different proposals"" and promised
to look into alternatives.
    He said an alternative now being looked at was for new
procedures for delaying IADB loan approval, to satisfy U.S.
concern that lending is currently too lax, rather than a change
in the basic voting structure.
    There would accordingly be a two-step procedure whereby it
would need just a 35 pct vote to delay loan approval for a
year, after which a second review would require a 40 pct
blocking vote.
    ""Any change in the basic voting structure would require a
change in the IADB's charter, and in turn a lengthy process of
prior approval by the Congresses of each country,"" Petricioli
said. In common with Venezuela, he expressed reservations on
the conditions that might be placed as a result of Washington's
proposals for increased IADB sectoral lending, but welcomed a
bigger role for the Bank in U.S. debt strategy.

1901,UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE,"Abnormally warm and dry weather over most
parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News
Agency said.
    It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in
eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant
diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing
areas, it said.
    The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and
other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than
seven months.
    The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of
water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March,
lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric
power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and
consumers.
    The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels
in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making
harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.
    The drought has also increased the number of forest fires.
More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340
hectares of forest by mid-February, it said.

special attention to reassessing the effect of exposures to
lesser developed countries on the holding companies' earnings
and capital.
    ""Brazil's unilateral moratorium on debt service payments
underscored the potential for polarization between bankers and
debtor countries,"" S and P said.
    S and P noted that while Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and
Venezuela each face unique economic problems, the lack of
progress toward moderating their debt service burdens has been
disappointing.
    However, the agency pointed out that a substantive
improvement in the large banks' financial positions has acted
as a counter-balance to the Latin American debt situation.
    Citing increasing financial strength, S and P said it
affirmed the debt ratings of Citicorp &lt;CCI>, Bankers Trust New
York Corp &lt;BT>, Bank of Boston Corp &lt;BKB> and J.P. Morgan and
Co Inc &lt;JPM>.
    S and P noted that most U.S. bank holding companies have
what it termed easily realizable capital resources available to
them, such as undervalued real estate, appreciated portfolio
securities and overfunded pension plans.
    ""Most bank managements appear committed to improving the
quality of their balance sheets,"" S and P said, noting many now
emphasize long-term strategies over short-term earnings.
    Standard and Poor's reduced Chase Manhattan's senior debt
to AA-minus from AA, subordinated debt to A-plus from AA-minus
and preferred stock to A from A-plus. The commercial paper of
the parent and its unit Chase Manhattan Bank of Canada were
affirmed at A-1-plus.
    Chase has 3.2 billion dlrs of debt outstanding. It has 6.4
billion dlrs of loans to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and
Venezuela - one of the highest exposures to lesser developed
countries among U.S. money centers.
    Chase's underlying profitability remains at median levels
because of its high expense structure, S and P said.
    S and P cut Chemical's and the unit Chemical New York
N.V.'s senior debt to AA-minus from AA and subordinated debt to
A-plus from AA-minus.
    About 1.2 billion dlrs of long-term debt was affected.
    The agency cited Chemical's relatively large exposure to
Latin American borrowers, particulary Brazil and Mexico,
continued high levels of nonperforming assets and the pending
acquisition of Texas Commerce.
    Aggregate exposure to Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and
Venezuela was almost four billion dlrs at year-end 1986, or 105
pct of equity and reserves, S and P pointed out.
    Irving's senior debt was reduced to A-plus from AA-minus,
with subordinated debt and preferred stock lowered to A from
A-plus. Its commercial paper was affirmed at A-111-1plus.
    Irving has about 500 mln dlrs of debt outstanding. Its
approximately 1.4 billion dlrs of loans to the four major Latin
debtor countries account for 110 pct of year-end equity and
reserves.
    S and P downgraded Manufacturers Hanover's senior debt to A
from A-plus, subordinated debt to A-minus from A and preferred
stock to BBB-plus from A-minus but affirmed its A-1 commercial
paper. The bank has 3.8 billion dlrs of debt.
    S and P noted that Manufacturers has about 6.7 billion dlrs
of loans to the major Latin debtor nations and has experienced
weak earnings.
    However, the unit CIT Group Holdings Inc's AA-minus senior
debt and A-1-plus commercial paper were affirmed.
    The rating agency cut Mellon's senior debt to A-plus from
AA and preferred stock to A from AA-minus. It has 1.1 billion
dlrs of debt securities.
    The commercial paper programs of Mellon Bank Canada and
Mellon Australia Ltd, guaranteed by the parent company, were
lowered to A-1 from A-1-plus.
    S and P cited continued lower operating earnings and rising
nonperforming assets and charge-offs for Mellon.
    Security Pacific's 1.7 billion dlrs of debt was downgraded.
Cut were its senior debt to AA from AA-plus, and subordinated
debt and preferred stock to AA-minus from AA.
    Security Pacific Overseas Finance N.V.'s debt issues were
reduced to AA from AA-plus. Affirmed were the parent's A-1-plus
commercial paper and the BBB-rated debt of the unit Security
Pacific Financial Systems.
    These actions reflected Security Pacific's continued high
levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, S and P said.

    Raised were the company's senior debt to Ba-1 from Ba-2 and
subordinated debt to Ba-3 from B-1. Moody's assigned a Ba-3

    Moody's cited reduced leverage, a strengthened equity base
and increased fixed-charge coverage. Federal Paper Board's
outstanding 125 mln dlrs of subordinated debt will be redeemed

12180,AUSTRALIA STOCK EXCHANGES ENTER NEW ERA,"The Australian Stock Exchange Ltd (ASX)
today took up the responsibility for administering a new
coordinated market made up of Australia's six former exchanges,
now operating as subsidiary trading floors.
    At the same time, rules prohibiting corporations and
non-stock-exchange members from holding more than 50 pct of
Australia's 101 brokerage firms were abolished, leaving brokers
exposed to greater deregulation.
    Industry sources said the moves will smooth the changeover
to screen-based trading and give the equities market one voice.
    Westpac Banking Corp &lt;WSTP.S> was one of the first to take
advantage of the changes by announcing today it would double
its stake in the Sydney firm &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd> to 100 pct.
    Brokers have been introduced to creeping deregulation over
the past three years after legislation passed in 1984 to end
restrictive trade practices forced the traditional partnerships
to open themselves at first to partial ownership by outside
institutions, and eventually to full ownership.
    The phase-in period has ended, and several major banks and
offshore financial institutions are investigating taking larger
stakes in Australian broking houses, industry sources said.
    Though deregulation was all but forced on brokers, most now
acknowledge that the influx of capital and contacts from
non-member shareholders has benefited the industry, they said.
    ""Deregulation has brought an infusion of additional capital
and a broader base of products,"" ASX chairman Ian Roach told
Reuters.
    Roach said fears that major bank shareholders would impose
a restrictive and conservative ""bank culture"" on the dynamic
sharebroking industry were unfounded.
    ""So far the banks have been mindful of the importance of
preserving the entrepreneurial aspect of sharebroking,"" he said.
    But some brokers said others are sceptical and expect that
the expiration of ""golden handcuff"" pacts, which tied partners to
their firms for a period after incorporation, could cause a
massive talent drain.
    Several leading brokers have already announced plans to
leave their firms and establish new private client businesses,
while others plan public floats.
    While bank shareholders have enjoyed dabbling in broking
during Australia's record two-and-a-half year bull run, they
could find themselves without the expertise they need during
more difficult times, some brokers said.
    Rene Rivkin, head of Sydney brokerage house &lt;Rivkin James
Capel Ltd>, said many brokers will resist anything that
restricts their individuality and entrepreneurial spirit, and
this could leave new entrants into the business short-staffed.
    ""If I were a bank I'm not sure I would have gone into
broking.... What's going to happen when a lot of these golden
handcuffs come to an end?"" Rivkin said.
    ""Only then will the banks know what they've got,"" he said.
    Rivkin's firm is 50 pct owned by Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK> unit &lt;Wardley Australia Ltd> and plans a
public float of between 25 and 30 pct.
    ""My relationship with the Hong Kong bank is wonderful. They
leave me alone and give me all the support I need.... Maybe if
we weren't doing so well there wouldn't be that support, but
that hasn't happened,"" he said.
    Other firms might not be so lucky, he said, and they could
find it difficult to preserve their independence when the bull
market ends.
    In the last two years, the value of the Australian
sharemarket has leapt 118 pct with turnover value up 152 pct to
31.24 billion dlrs in the year to June 30, 1986.
    That growth put existing trading systems and clearing
houses under pressure, and unification of the six sovereign
exchanges should accelerate the development of screen-based
trading and a single clearing house, industry sources said.
    From July this year 30 leading stocks will be traded in a
pilot of the ASX's screen trading system which, depending on
its reception by brokers, is expected to replace trading floors
over the next four years, industry sources said.

10063,FORMER TREASURY SECRETARY PLEADS GUILTY TO TAX EVASION,"Former Secretary of the Treasury
Robert Anderson, whom Dwight Eisenhower once said deserved to
be president, pleaded guilty to income tax evason charges and
illegally running an offshore bank.
    Anderson, declaring that he was ""deeply regretful,"" admitted
to evading tax on 127,500 dlrs in undeclared income.   Much of
the money was paid to him for lobbying for controversial South
Korean evangelist Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.
    The 77-year-old Anderson was President Eisenhower's
treasury secretary from 1957 to 1961 and a prominent
businessman afterwards. In his memoirs, Eisenhower said
Anderson deserved to be president.
    Standing before Federal Court Judge Edmund Palmieri,
Anderson, who faces up to 10 years in jail, said he had
recently undergone two operations and treatment for alcoholism.
    The judge set May 7 for sentencing and U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani declared the government would ask that
Anderson be sent to jail.
    According to the indictment, Anderson was a prinicipal  of
the Commercial Exchange Bank and Trust Ltd of Anguilla in the
British West Indies for two years ending in 1985.
    During that time, government prosecutors said the bank
conducted operations in New York city but failed to register
with state and federal banking authorities. Depositors have
lost at least 4 mln dlrs.
    Anderson pleaded gulity only for the tax year 1984 but
admitted other tax transgressions for the previous year and
faces civil fines for both years.
    Among other things, he said he received 80,000 dlrs in 1983
from a shell corporation for lobbying for the Unification
Church. The money was given to him as a no-interest loan
repayable in 1990 but the government said it should have been
reported as income.

    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mark IV said its top officials told Baird executives at a March
17 meeting that while Mark IV may buy more Baird common stock,
it presently intends to hold it to the 25 pct limit.
    Mark IV, which first disclosed its stake and interest in
Baird on March 10, has reported it holds 391,800 Baird common
shares, or 17.6 pct of the total outstanding.
    Mark IV said it also agreed at the meeting that if it
decides to seek control of Baird, it would be through a
negotiated merger or business combination or through a tender
offer in which Baird would have at least 24 hours notice.
    Baird, in turn, agreed not to take any defensive measures
without giving Mark IV at least 24 hours notice, it said.
    Baird also confirmed that a takeover defense plan it
already has which is triggered by the accumulation of more than
25 pct of its stock, would not be triggered by a tender offer,
Mark IV said. Both parties also agreed to adjourn pending

19353,LLOYDS BANK BOND MARKET WITHDRAWAL CALLED PRUDENT,"Lloyds Bank Plc's &lt;LLOY.L> decision to
withdraw from making markets in Eurobonds and U.K. Government
bonds (gilts) sent shivers down the spines of other market
participants but was viewed as prudent by banking analysts.
    ""It (the move) really isn't a surprise. They lost a lot of
money in the early stages of the gilt market and now they want
to cut their losses while they can,"" said Keith Brown, banking
analyst at Greenwell Montagu.
    ""The question now is how many other gilt market makers will
face a similar fate,"" one senior gilt market maker said.
    Eurobond market participants were equally stunned. ""They are
the first firm of that size I can remember to have pulled out
of eurobond market making altogether,"" said a member of the
Association of International Bond Dealers London staff.
    Other Eurobond market participants said that while Lloyds
had frequently changed the staff of some of its eurobond
operations, it was hard to believe they were in trouble.
    With this action Lloyds, the third largest U.K. clearing
bank, becomes the first U.K. clearing bank to withdraw from the
gilt market following the Big Bang deregulation of the London
Stock Exchange in October.
    Earlier this year Midland Bank Plc &lt;MDBL.L>, the fourth
largest clearing bank, opted out of making markets in equities
on the grounds that the return did not justify the expense. It
continues as a market maker in gilts, however. In a prepared
statement, Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman said the
bank had a ""relatively small position in these two overcrowded
markets and we have decided to reallocate the resources to
opportunities which promise a better return on our shareholders
investment.""
    Lloyds said it would maintain its presence in short-term
securities trading, swaps and other treasury products.
    Alan Moore, Lloyds Treasurer, told Reuters that the
decision was forward looking and followed a ""strategic review"" of
the prospects for Lloyds in these markets. ""We decided the
return just was not attractive,"" he said.
    Although the decision was made at a meeting of Lloyds board
this morning, Moore said that it had been under consideration
for some time.
    He denied that the move was a ""reaction to events in the
trading room"" although he acknowledged that the bank's gilt
operations were not profitable in the early stages of the new
market.
    Greenwell's Brown noted that for all of 1986, Lloyds
Merchant Bank sustained a loss of 28 mln stg, most of which he
said were accounted for by the Eurobond and gilt operations.
For all of 1986, Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of 700 mln
stg. ""Lloyds is so big, it can easily absorb these losses,"" Brown
said, noting that they are minuscule when compared with the
bank's exposure to Latin America.
    U.K. Clearing banks have come under pressure to increase
their provisions against bad loans to third world countries
since Citibank announced plans to add three billion dlrs to its
provisions in mid-May.
    National Westminster Bank Plc &lt;NWBL.L>, the largest of the
clearers, became the first of the U.K. Clearers to follow
Citicorp's &lt;CCI> move earlier this week when it said it was
adding some 466 mln stg to its sovereign debt provisions.
    Lloyds has the second largest exposure to Latin America
after Midland Bank, the smallest of the four clearers.
    Lloyds has said it is reviewing the situation and Moore
denied that today's action had any connection. ""It is totally
unrelated,"" he said.
    Trading in Eurobonds and gilts had ended by the time the
announcement was made. But market participants were
dumbfounded.
    ""We only heard the news about 20 minutes before the
announcement. I had no idea it was coming. I don't know if I
still have job,"" said one trader at Lloyds who declined to be
identified. Lloyds' Moore said that the bank would do all it
could to redeploy the staff affected by the decision in other
parts of the bank. But even though Lloyds' share of these
markets was relatively small, other market participants,
particularly in gilts, were unnerved.
    One senior gilt market maker noted that the news comes
during a period when both gilt and Eurosterling markets have
been battered by the lack of investor participation, following
the June 11 U.K. general election.
    Most firms had held long positions on expectations that a
return of the ruling Conservative party would prompt heavy
demand. These expectations have failed to be met and both
markets have sustained sizeable losses since the election.
    Lloyds has long been the subject of rumors that it was
experiencing problems with its gilt operations and officials
have never denied that the early stages were unprofitable.
    Gilt market sources suggested that one of the problems
facing Lloyds on the gilt side was its decision to build up its
own team. It was the only clearer which did not purchase a
broker or a jobber (middle man) in the run-up to Big Bang.
    Under the old system, these functions have been conducted
separately but now market makers perform both tasks.
    But even long before Big Bang, market makers had expressed
doubts that the gilt market would be large enough to sustain 27
market makers, even if turnover increased substantially.
    And with Lloyds withdrawal, many market makers believe that
some of the remaining 26 may opt to bow out gracefully.

with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with
security, nor reason and wisdom.""
    U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and
American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.
    The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response
to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti
tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday.

    The world economy was growing and dangers of inflation were

15745,LOWER U.S. FARM PAYMENT BASE EYED FOR SAVINGS,"Reducing the amount of crop base a
farmer can receive deficiency payments on is being looked at as
one way to cut the U.S. agriculture budget for fiscal year
1988, congressional aides and lobbyists said.
    Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) has suggested that the
planted crop base a producer receives deficiency payments on be
reduced by five pct, an aide to Stenholm said.
    The aide said no official proposal has yet been drawn up,
but that as it becomes more clear exactly how much agriculture
spending will have to reduced, specific numbers will be
discussed and a proposal could ""very likely"" be drafted.
    Under the proposal, if a farmer idled 20 pct of his acreage
base and was eligible to plant the remaining 80 pct, he would
receive payments on only 75 pct of his total base.
    Current regulations provide farmers with deficiency
payments on 100 pct of their non-idled acreage.
    Reducing the payment base by five pct could save around 400
to 500 mln dlrs, but would have to be applied to the 1987 crop
programs in order for any savings to accrue in fiscal year
1988, an Agriculture Department economist said.
    Stenholm's aide said when the proposal is officially
offered, it would likely be an amendment to the budget
reconciliation bill.
    Other options currently being talked about as a way to cut
one to two billion dlrs from the farm budget include increasing
acreage reduction programs, limiting farm payments,
implementing a 0/92 acreage set-aside program or limiting the
use of generic in-kind certificates.

said that U.S. crude oil production in February declined 9.8

said that domestic demand for petroleum products, as measured
by products supplied, continued to rise reaching 16.3 mln
barrels a day in the month, up 1.5 pct from February 1986.
    API noted the drop in crude oil output coupled with a
drop in natural gas liquids production, which was off 11 pct
from February 1986 levels, represented a decline in U.S.
production of more than one mln barrels a day.
    API said the decline in domestic production and the rise in
demand brought petroleum imports to about six mln barrels a day
in February, a 30.3 pct increase from last year's level.
    So far this year, API said growth in domestic demand, which
was up 2.9 pct from last year's year-to-date level, has slowed

11245,NAKASONE SAYS JAPAN PLANS DRASTIC ECONOMIC PACKAGE,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said
Japan plans to work out a drastic set of pump-priming measures
immediately after Parliament passes the 1987/88 budget.
    He told a Lower House budget committee the government is
likely to consider a supplementary budget for fiscal 1987 and a
new policy for the ceiling on budgetary requests by government
agencies and ministries for 1988/89.
    The government had cut budgetary requests in the past five
years in line with Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction policy of
stopping the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990.
    The passage of the budget is expected in late May.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said in the same session
Japan should use fiscal funds as much as possible to meet
domestic and foreign demands for greater domestic growth.
    Miyazawa said it appears difficult for the government to
stop the deficit-financing bond issues by the targetted time.
    Nakasone said he had instructed his Liberal Democratic
Party to prepare its own economic package in time for his
one-week visit to Washington starting on April 29.

12857,NORANDA SAYS FIRE CAUSED 10 MLN DLRS IN DAMAGE,"&lt;Noranda Inc> said a copper
mine fire that killed one miner and trapped 44 others for
nearly a day caused an estimated 10 mln Canadian dlrs in
damage.
    The fire, which started Wednesday and burned for more than
24 hours, destroyed the mine's three-year-old conveyor system,
officials said.
    Michel Lefebvre, vice president of operations, said Noranda
will operate the mine at about one third of its normal 72,000
short ton annual finished capacity, using above ground
reserves, until it decides whether to keep the mine open.
    ""The events we sustained yesterday and the day before are a
very serious setback for Gaspe Mines operations,"" Lefebvre said.
Gaspe Mines is the name of the Noranda division that operates
the Murdochville mine.
    He said it would take four or five months to bring
operations up to full capacity if the company decides to do so,
adding that he believes there is a good chance Noranda will

9687,MEMBERS VOTE TO DISSOLVE U.S. FARM CO-OP,"The shareholders of Illinois
Cooperative Futures Co voted to dissolve the 26-year-old firm,
the futures trading arm of 85 farm cooperatives, its president
said.
    Thomas E. Mulligan, president of the board of directors,
said 87 pct of the 61 members voting favored dissolution.
    The directors recommended the move, citing falling volume
and higher costs, when it called a special shareholders meeting
last month.
    Mulligan said the cooperative would continue operating
until April 24, when the member cooperatives will have to begin
clearing their futures trades through other companies.
    Mulligan said one of the members, Farmers Commodities of
Des Moines, Iowa, was attempting to organize a new cooperative
to replace Illinois Coop as a clearing company.
    Sources close to Farmers Commodities confirmed its plans,
but Hal Richards, president, could not be reached immediately
for comment, and it was unknown how many cooperatives might be
willing to band together.
    Industry sources said Farmers Commodities would face a
difficult task in setting up a new clearing organization by
April 24, the day Illinois Cooperative will be dissolved.
    They would have to obtain commitments from a sufficient
number of cooperatives to meet minimum capital requirements,
obtain trading memberships, and set up the office mechanisms to
handle futures trading.
    In the meantime, commercial clearing firms have been
courting the individual coops, trying to obtain their business
with low trading rates.
    If Farmers Commodities is unable to set up a clearing
organization by April 24, individual members will find other
homes, and they're unlikely to change clearing firms a second
time, one industry source said.
    The demise of Illinois Coop was set in motion by the
withdrawl of Growmark, Inc., the largest member with more than
70 pct of the capital stock, according to sources within the
cooperative.
    Mulligan acknowledged prior to the vote that Growmark had
no need to belong to the cooperative since it became affiliated
last year with Archer Daniels Midland.
    But he said Illinois Cooperative would still have been able
to meet minimum capital requirements without Growmark.
    The vote to dissolve the organization was met with ""a
certain amount of pang,"" he said. ""But in the final analysis,
the decision has to be economic, not emotional.""

21532,PHILIPPINE INFLATION PREDICTED TO RISE,"The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will
rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government
implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10
pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,
Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.
    The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily
pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight
pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average
higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.
    The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the
Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).
    The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation
rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4
pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita
said. Both were proposed last month.
    Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct
by the National Economic and Development Authority early this
month.
    In the first three months of the year, inflation was a
negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5
and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics
Office said.
    The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct
in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September
respectively, the National Statistics Office said.
    It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water
prices.
    The government's six and eight peso wage increases would
displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number
of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.

seeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill a
provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the
U.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP,
to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including
the Soviet Union, Senate staff said.
    Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to
recoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading
practices.
    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)
is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to
broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be
eligible for the subsidies, sources said.
    The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor
(D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) --
also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork
producers and processors from Canadian imports.
    The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa),
would clarify the definition of ""industry"" in determining whether
or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers.
    Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the
International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live
swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming
U.S. producers.
    The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simply
replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork.

one-third more than the 1970-84 average and 300,000 acres more
than the amount reported at this time last year, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In addition to the land reported damaged, another 15 mln
acres are unprotected and susceptible to wind damage, 34 pct
more than the 1970-84 average, but about one mln acres less
than last year.
    The states hardest hit were in the Northern Plains, where
wind damaged 2.4 mln acres, an increase of 1.5 mln acres over
the amount reported a year ago, the department said.
    Suffering the most damage in the Northern Plains were
Montana (1.3 mln acres), and North Dakota (518,500 acres.)
    Of the five Southern Plains states, only Colorado reported
an increase in wind-damaged land over last year, it said.
    Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas reported a reduction
in damaged land, due in part to emergency conservation tillage
practices and in part to rainfall and weather conditions.
    Of the land damaged, 96.2 pct was cropland, 3.5 pct
rangeland, and 0.9 pct was other land.
    Inadequate snow cover and high winds, coupled with a lack
of erosion control practices such as windbreaks and

weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown
winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the
U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.
    In a field report, the officer said indications were that
winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared
with 38,000 last year.
    He said the damage was probably more limited in southern
and central regions and most widespread in the north.
    Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where
little or no snow cover was present, he added.
    The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine
during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well
developed plants and for winter barley.
    Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing
water occurred in the fields.
    The officer said repairing damage will probably call for
special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and
where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed
applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.

12337,FURTHER DECLINES IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES POSSIBLE,"After an already steep fall in the past
week, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declines
in the near term, financial analysts said.
    However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond
futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the
contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before
resuming their decline.
    Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the
course of the dollar, they said.
    ""As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,"" said Dean
Witter analyst Karen Gibbs.
    The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low
against the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday when
several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their
prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct.
    ""Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar,
foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline
is over,"" Gibbs said.
    The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt
futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation.
    Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the
meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the Federal
Open Market Committee, this week, analysts said.
    ""To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a
steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look
suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating
inflation,"" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEntee
and McGinley Inc.
    Such expectations could mean that ""a shift in policy toward
restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious
consideration,"" at the FOMC meeting, he said.
    Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly
visible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said.
    Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in
seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he
said. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln
dlrs over the past several months, he said.
    In the meantime, however, ""the market looks a bit
oversold,"" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures.
    Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could
drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test
chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32.
    Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston
said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the
nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32.
    ""All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and
buyers have surfaced at that level,"" Keefe said.
    If that level is broken, and the dollar continues to
decline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to
decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend
line dating back to 1984.

18695,CFTC'S DAVIS URGES CAUTION ON OFF-EXCHANGE ISSUE,"Regulations governing hedging and risk
management should be revised and development of new futures
instruments cautiously monitored in dealing with the growth of
off-exchange futures instruments, Robert Davis, a commissioner
on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, said.
    Davis told the Chicago chapter of the Futures Industry
Association Commodity Research Division last night ""there is no
cause for undue alarm"" in the growth of off-exchange
instruments.
    However, he said, the CFTC ""must clarify jurisdictional and
regulatory issues"" by maintaining the safeguards intended by
commodity regulations while encouraging ""the further
development of competitive markets.""
    ""There is not a single off-exchange issue, there cannot be
one policy approach, and to the extent that problems exist,
there cannot be one solution,"" Davis said.
    The development of off-exchange instruments with futures
contract characteristics has become of increasing concern to
federal regulators who are trying to define what issues are
covered under existing regulations and where new regulations
are needed to protect private investment.
    Davis said the CFTC should step up enforcement where
off-exchange instruments are intended to compete with
exchange-traded issues, correct ""regulatory inflexibility""
which may force new instruments off exchange, and ""delineate
and separate those harmful off-exchange developments from the
many that are not.""
    ""We cannot ignore that some of the growth of off-exchange
trading represents a desirable further development of financial
forward contracts that complement, rather than compete with,
the relatively new financial futures contracts,"" Davis said.
    He said a CFTC task force is continuing its investigation
of the off-exchange issue.

    Bristol-Myers, the third largest drug company in the U.S.,
said that ""considerable work remains to be done before it is

safety and efficacy of an agent, a company then submits a new
drug application to the FDA. It may take three to five years
before a new drug application is submitted and another two to
three years before the FDA approves a drug for marketing.
    Earlier this month, Bristol-Myers said the vaccine produced
antibodies to the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys. The vaccine
uses a live smallpox vaccine to carry two protein on the AIDS
virus that may, in theory, prod the immune system to produce
neutralizaing antibodies against AIDS.

8176,BEGHIN-SAY SEES SOLUTION TO EC SUGAR DISPUTE,"A settlement could soon be reached in the
dispute between European sugar producers and the European
Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes,
president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading
the protest, told journalists today.
    ""Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days
indicate that we are moving towards a solution,"" he said, adding
that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000
tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.
    Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of
sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC's
policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed
to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain
by offering sugar into EC intervention.
    At last week's tender the EC Commission made an apparent
concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European
currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers
say is needed, compared with the previous week's rebate which
was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.
    Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the
producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the
long-term desire of producers to export to the world market,
providing they were not losing money by doing so.
    Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April
1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or
at any time over the following five weeks before the official
payment date.
    The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal
market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers.

    Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
Japan as well as the United States.
    The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by
Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
    However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
already the world's largest grain importer.
    Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
requirements in 1985.
    Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
beef, citrus products and rice.
    Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
    The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
rising production by exporting countries, he added.
    Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
output with expensive programs, Maki said.

10195,FARM CREDIT AID SEEN BROADENED TO OTHER LENDERS,"Farm-state senators indicated they
may broaden a Farm Credit System rescue package to include aid
for borrowers from private lenders such as commercial banks, as
well as the farm credit system.
    Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture subcommittee responsible for farm credit, said
legislation to rescue the financially-troubled system should
provide help to borrowers from all lenders to agriculture.
    ""We must provide some form of interest rate buydown,
principal reduction relief for all eligible farmers and
ranchers regardless of their lending institution,"" Boren said.
    Boren's statement received bipartisan support from Sen.
James McClure, R-Idaho, who agreed that the aid package should
cover all lenders to agriculture.
    The comments by Senators of both parties, plus endorsements
for the across-the-board approach from the nation's largest
farm organization, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and
from the system itself, appeared to significantly broaden the
focus of the rescue legislation for the farm credit system.
Until now, agriculture officials had focused exclusively on how
to resurrect the failing system.
    Boren said borrowers from private lenders such as
commercial banks and life insurance companies must be included
in the aid package because ""it would not be fair to address
only the problems of Farm Credit System borrowers.""
    However, Boren and other proponents of an across-the-board
interest rate or principal buydown did not say how much the
broad approach would cost.
    But Neil Harl, professor of economics at Iowa State
University told the hearing the cost could be in the range of
3.5 billion dlrs annually.
    By trying to draw into the farm credit rescue package all
farm borrowers, Boren and other Senators appeared to be
reacting to pressure from private lenders and their borrowers,
who fear they will be put at a competitive disadvantage by the
government rescue of the farm credit system and its borrowers.
    The farm credit system is the nation's largest lender to
agriculture with 39 pct of all farm real estate loans, but
private lenders account for nearly a quarter of loans on
farmland and 34 pct of farm operating loans, official figures
show.
    The American Bankers Association, in testimony to the
hearing, warned the farm credit rescue should not be structured
to favor the system over other lenders.
    As one way to meet the concern of private lenders, several
Senators, the farm credit system, and farm organizations
endorsed creation of a secondary market on farm real estate
loans, called ""aggie mae"", which is sought by private lenders.
    ""We are also exploring the possibility of including in the
farm credit bill, the establishment of a secondary market for
agricultural loans that would be available to all lenders,""
Sen. Boren said.

19200,DUTCH TO MEET 1987 PUBLIC SECTOR DEFICIT TARGET,"Dutch public authorities are on course
to meet the 1987 public sector deficit target of 7.9 pct of net
national income (NNI) despite excess spending by the central
government, according to a leaked official report.
    The so-called Spring Report, giving latest revenue and
expenditure figures and to be discussed by the Dutch cabinet
today, was leaked in advance to the Dutch press. The Dutch
Finance Ministry declined to comment on the press reports.
    Newspapers quoted the report, drafted by Finance Minister
Onno Ruding, as saying unexpected rises in revenue would
compensate for excess spending of 3.1 billion guilders.
    Ruding, putting this year's public sector borrowing
requirement 0.1 percentage point below last September's target
at 7.8 pct, criticised the excess spending but will not seek
additional spending cuts for 1987 because of the surprise boost
in revenue, the report was quoted as saying.
    Excess spending by the central government was put at 2.8
billion guilders, while market factors accounted for another
300 mln in unbudgetted expenditure.
    But 1987 revenue was boosted by an unexpected 3.55 billion,
including 1.9 billion in tax revenue and 500 mln guilders in
income from natural gas sales.
    Ruding has said the 1987 excess spending will burden the
1988 budget with an additional 1.9 billion and the cabinet has
already pledged 1.2 billion in cuts to narrow the gap.
    The cabinet is to discuss in coming months what further
austerity measures will be needed next year to keep the
government on target for its 1990 aim of a public sector
borrowing requirement of no more than 5.25 pct of NNI.
    Ruding has already met opposition from the Liberal and
Christian-Democrat factions carrying the government majority in
parliament to his calls for more spending cuts in the 1988
budget to counter a slow-down in economic growth.

despite the U.S. Attack against Iranian oil platforms and
growing tension in the Gulf, Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo
Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
    He described the situation as ""extremely tense,"" but said
Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices
because supply and demand were roughly equal.
    Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 18.5
mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now
pumping above 18 mln bpd, he told a news conference.
    Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was
precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their
current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction
continued.

Petroleum Exporting Countries were ""overproducing in an

1842,RIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT,"The failure of talks to introduce
new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee
Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil
having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President
of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon
said.
    He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25
pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable
as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.
    ""Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year,""
Calmon added.
    Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota,
Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln
bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln,
leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.
    ""It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was
better than such a quota reduction,"" he added.
    In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green
coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe
drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under
10 mln bags.
    Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of
which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest
this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.
    The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last
year's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe
it was higher than this.

17367,NERVOUS CONSOLIDATION SEEN IN CURRENCY FUTURES,"Currency futures at the International
Monetary Market (IMM) are likely to consolidate near current
levels in nervous trading conditions over the next few days,
although underlying sentiment remains positive, currency
analysts said.
    ""Currencies are likely to muddle around these levels,"" said
Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Parker Mills.
    Traders are unwilling to establish either long or short
positions in futures because of uncertainty over upcoming trade
talks and U.S. trade legislation, they said.
    Japanese prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President
Reagan will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss trade tensions
between their two countries, while at the same time the
Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on
a controversial trade bill.
    ""Unless something really surprising comes out of the
Nakasone/Reagan talks, I don't see the dollar getting above 142
(yen) and 1.83 (marks),"" Mills said.
    The equivalent in futures of those interbank levels are
about 0.007050 to 0.007025 in the June yen contract and about
0.5500 in June marks, she said.
    June yen closed at 0.007191 on Tuesday while June marks
finished the day at 0.5602.
    Mills said, however, that ""the chances of them (Reagan and
Nakasone) coming up with something new are limited."" One
possibility might be a Japanese discount rate cut, but ""they
probably won't do that unless we raise our discount rate.""
    Recent firmness in the federal funds rate and the Federal
Reserve's slowness in adding reserves to the banking system has
heightened sentiment that the money-policy making body has
already tightened credit and a discount rate hike is possible,
analysts said.
    Recent weakness in currencies and strength in the dollar
has been more the result of nervous shortcovering ahead of the
meeting rather than reaction to the White House statement
Monday supporting a stable dollar, said Harris bank currency
analyst Earl Johnson.
    Traders ""are worried about the outcome of the talks between
Reagan and Nakasone,"" and as the talks are late in the week,
the market may not get a chance to react to any developments
until Monday, Johnson said.
    Until then, Johnson expects the dollar to remain in a broad
range between 1.77 and 1.85 marks and 137 to 140.50 yen.
    Chicago Corp analyst John Bilson, however, expects a rally
in the European currencies over the near-term, while the yen,
at this point is overbought.
    ""The Japanese are moving away from the U.S. market,"" and
investment funds formerly directed to the U.S. are likely to
flow into Europe, Bilson said.
    The chief beneficiary of such a flow of funds will be
sterling, Bilson said.
    ""Sterling rates are about four pct above Japanese rates,
despite the half point rate cut,"" Bilson said. Major U.K. banks
lowered their base lending rates today to 9.5 pct.
    In addition to a favorable interest rate spread which
should attract funds, Bilson said the firm oil market and the
strong political situation of Prime Minister Thatcher also make
British investments attractive.
    Passage of the trade bill, which includes an amendment by
Missouri Democrat Richard Gephardt that would force a 10 pct
annual cut in imports from countries with an excessive trade
surplus with the U.S. if they fail to remove unfair trade
barriers to the U.S. after six months of negatiations, would
likely pressure the yen, Bilson said.
    Bilson, however, said the legislation is unlikely to pass,
but that Nakasone is likely to bring a promise to open Japanese
markets to U.S. goods and back it up with government contracts
with U.S. manufacturers.

elected by the copper workers union for the first time since
the left-wing government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in
a 1973 coup.
     Nicanor Araya, a member of the Popular Democratic Movement
(MDP), was named president of the Chilean Confederation of
Copperworkers (CTC), which groups 22,000 workers employed in
the state-owned copper mines, union officials said.
    Other members of the MDP, which includes the communist
party and a faction of the socialist party, took five of the
principal positions on the union's directorate.
    The state-owned copper company of Chile (CODELCO) produces
around 90 pct of the country's copper output of some one mln
tonnes per year. Chile is the world's leading copper exporter
and sales account for just under 50 pct of its export income.
    The MDP won six out of the 14 places on the union's
directorate in elections earlier this month, with the christian
democratic party holding five and the remainder being won by
independents.
    But the left-wing was left in control of the union after
the christian democrats and independents failed to reach
agreement on a joint candidate for the presidency and withdrew
from negotiations.
    Union elections were called following the resignation of
former president Rodolfo Seguel last October.
    Seguel, a christian democrat and Chile's best-known union
leader, said he was forced to step down after repeated court
actions brought by CODELCO prevented the union from operating.
    The labour leader, who now heads the inter-union national
workers command (CNT), was among 500 workers sacked by CODELCO
following a strike in 1983.
    The strike, the only copper industry stoppage staged in the
past 13 years, marked the start of a wave of protests against
the military rule of President Augusto Pinochet.
     CODELCO argued that Seguel could not continue as union
leader when no longer employed by the company.

19828,"SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING","Corporate mergers and acquisitions
in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had
only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a
leading business-backed organization said.
    The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business
firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a
nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered
some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding
communities had not.
    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left
due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but
another 21 firms were added to the list.
    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.
During the period, only six located in the city achieved
Fortune 500 status.
    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of
McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study
grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously
hurt the economic climate of northern California.
    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been
lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were
created during the period.
    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater
rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest
of the United States and California.
    Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and
chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news
conference that the region had difficulties in persuading
companies to locate there because of a fragmented local
political system.
    But he said that because of the amenities of living in San
Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other
metropolitan area.
    ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it's
a hell of a place to do business with government.""
    The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf
Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the
restructuring activity.
    Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period
were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;
Cooke and Rolm.
    Companies that grew enough during the period to make the
Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,
McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.
    The study by the management consulting firm said that,
partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth
in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.
    In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership
had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and
charitable activities.

assets and federal tax refunds resulting from last year's loss
to add about one billion dlrs to its normal cash flows from
operations in 1987, its annual report said.
    Last year, the report noted, the cash flow from operations
dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and
3.2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices.
    The report, prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>
disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard's stock, put 1987
capital spending at 1.6 billion dlrs, down from the 1.7 billion
dlrs projected in January.
    Standard's capital spending totaled 1.77 billion dlrs in
1986.
    The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2.41
billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2.65 billion barrels a
year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11.4
mln barrels last year from 23.2 mln in 1985.
    But it said gas reeserves rose to 7.31 trillion cubic feet
from 7.22 trillion at the end of 1985 despite a 30.9 mln cubic
feet downward revision in previous reserve estimates during
1986. Discoveries and other additions totaled 200.5 billion
cubic feet last year, up from 175.9 billion in 1985, it added.
    Standard said both oil and gas production increased last
year -- to 726,600 barrels per day from 719,700 barrels the
previous day and to 154.4 mln cubic feet daily from 10.1 mln in

1616,ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION,"Drilling for oil in California is
likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
said.
    Because much of the crude oil in California fields is
thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
is seen in drilling, they said.
    ""Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,""
said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.
    Few new wells now are being drilled.
    Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared
to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil
Information Services, which tracks California drilling
activity.
    ""It's in the dregs right now,"" said Bolster of the state's
drilling activity.
    Current prices are not enough to justify increased
drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent
Producers Association.
    While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact
to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
eventually fell.
    Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have
slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
of about 17 dlrs.
    More than half of California's oil comes from stripper
wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
extract, Malmgreen said.
    ""It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,""
Malmgreen said.
    Many stripper wells along the southern California coast
produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
    The outlook for future production in California is clouded
by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
    In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which
produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
drilling has slowed to a crawl.
    Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in
1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of
the state energy commission. So far this year only five
exploratory wells have been drilled.
    ""I don't think they'll even get to what they did last
year,"" Mitchell said.
    No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
the decade, Mitchell said.
    Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
number of producing wells and overall production.
    Between February and October of 1986, the number of
producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy
Commission.
    In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output
fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
    Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil
production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.
    Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986
was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of
Conservation.
    ""Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,""
Guerard said.

10863,U.K. GOVERNMENT BONDS PLUMMET WITH U.S. ISSUES,"The U.K. Government bond market closed
showing severe losses ranging to almost 1-1/2 points as sharp
falls for U.S Treasury bonds resulting from pronounced dollar
weakness exacerbated existing uncertainty, dealers said.
    Selling was described as relatively modest, although very
few buyers appeared to take up the slack. Much of the momentum
was derived from the futures market, where a high 33,074 lots
were traded in the long gilt June contract.
    The Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 closed 1-7/16
point lower at 135-20/32 stg pct while the Treasury 10 pct due
1991 ended at 105-12/32 for a fall of 1-3/16.
    Dealers noted that market confidence had already been at a
low ebb, with much of the recent impressive rise whittled away
last week as investors reacted nervously to opinion polls
showing unexpectedly strong gains for the centrist
Liberal/Social Democratic alliance.
    The market had been sustained in large part during its
recent rally by a virtual conviction that the ruling
Conservative party would first call and then win a general
election early this summer.
    However, advances credited to the alliance last week have
cast doubt on both assumptions.
    ""Turnover in the cash market has actually been quite small,""
one dealer said, adding that price movements had been very
volatile at times.
    After losing ground heavily in the Far East in tandem with
the flagging dollar, U.S. Bonds fell further in London trading
but showed some signs of recovery late in the U.S. Morning as
the dollar steadied a little against the yen. The latest period
of weakness for the dollar has accentuated fears that currency
risk might induce Japanese investors in particular to undertake
dramatic reductions in their portfolios of U.S. Treasury
issues.
    Dealers noted that early strength in the index-linked
sector of the market, which had enabled the Government broker
to supply some of both index-linked stock tranches announced on
Friday, had soon fallen prey to the general depression
affecting gilts.
    The Treasury 2-1/2 pct index-linked stock due 2020 closed
just under one point lower at 100-11/32 stg pct.

5643,SCHLUMBERGER &lt;SLB> ENDS PACT TO SELL FAIRCHILD,"Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated an
agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of its
Fairchild Semiconductor operations.
    The company said the rising political controversy in the
U.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of
the Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable
time.
    The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department
and the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national security
grounds.
    The company said termination of the agreement opened other
possibilities, including a possible leveraged buyout of the
semiconductor maker by Fairchild management.
    In the interim, Fairchild would continue its ongoing
business within Schlumberger, the oilfield services concern
said.
    Last October, Schlumberger announced the sale of the
Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in
the fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended up
recording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year.
    Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale, but
industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about
200 mln dlrs.
    The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S.
Justice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations
about the transaction since it was announced.
    Government officials have expressed concern that the sale
could reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by putting
key advanced technology into Japanese hands.
    New, high-technology semiconductors are used in

20028,WILL WORLD RECESSION FOLLOW STOCK MARKET PLUNGE?,"Some economists fear a world recession if
stock exchanges continue to plunge. Others are more sanguine.
    The pessimists say the stocks shakeout is destroying
personal assets and dampening consumption.
    ""The real economic effects can be significant -- the
destruction of wealth and a deflationary impact on the economy,""
said an economist at a U.S. Securities house.
    But other economists said such fears were overblown.
    ""Because of lower appreciation of corporate or personal
assets, that much negative impact could be observed (in the
U.S.),"" said Keikichi Honda, general manager of economic
research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
    ""But the appreciation of stock prices has not been playing
such a major role in the entire U.S. Gross national product
(GNP),"" Honda said.
    The pessimists noted that the record fall on Wall Street on
Monday was sparked by fears the U.S. Economy is heading for a
recession or serious slowdown much earlier than expected.
    But the optimists said a dampening effect on consumption
due to stock market losses was less likely in Japan.
    ""In Japan the weight of stocks in individuals' total assets
is less than in the U.S., And the total weight of individuals'
holdings in the stock market is less, so there will be less
damage than in the U.S.,"" said an economist at one of Japan's
major brokerage houses.
    ""Japan is taking strong measures to stimulate domestic
demand, so while there could be some impact from the reduction
of assets value, it would not be a major impact,"" said the Bank
of Tokyo's Honda.
    Optimists also pointed to incipient declines in U.S.
Interest rates as a positive sign for the U.S. Economy.
    ""U.S. Interest rates are coming down so there is a feeling
that interest rates have hit their ceiling, and the U.S.
Economy is strong, so there should be no direct impact from the
collapse of share prices,"" said Toshiaki Kakimoto, Sumitomo Bank
Ltd chief economist.
    Some economists suggested that should markets continue to
slump, the major industrial nations may have to discuss
possible joint lowering of official discount rates.
    ""Until last week, a discussion of lower rates was
unthinkable, now it's not,"" said the Japanese brokerage house
economist.
    ""There has been a move from the purely rational to the
emotional -- it's a central bankers' nightmare,"" said the
foreign economist. ""It will require strong global leadership by
politicians to snuff out,"" he said.
    However, ""previously, the stocks correction was due to fears
of higher interest rates, a possible resurgence of inflation
and the depreciation of the dollar,"" said Nobuyuki Ueda, senior
economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd.
    ""Now some people have an uneasy feeling about the outlook of
the U.S. Economy,"" Ueda said.
    ""If the stock market is a leading indicator of the future
movement of the economy, this decline will have very
significant implications for the U.S. Economy,"" he said.
    ""If the low levels hold, those who were keeping consumption
high because of unrealised gains could curb consumption,"" said
Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd economist Ron Napier. ""If the paper
gains aren't there, people won't spend.""
    A U.S. Recession could then trigger similar declines in

16068,DOLLAR OPENS AT TOKYO RECORD LOW OF 143.75 YEN,"The dollar opened at a record Tokyo low
of 143.75 yen despite aggressive Bank of Japan intervention,
dealers said.
    The previous record low was 144.70 yen set on March 30. The
opening compares with 143.90/144.00 yen at the close in New
York.
    The central bank bought dollars through Tokyo brokers just
before and after the market opening, the dealers said.
    The intervention took place when the dollar fell to 143.20
yen, one dealer said.
    The dollar opened at 1.8155/60 marks against 1.8187/97 in
New York.
    The dollar fell as low as 142.90 yen despite central bank
intervention at 143.00 yen, dealers said.
    Selling pressure was strong from securities houses and
institutional investors in hectic and nervous trading on
underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar, they said.
    Most dealers were surpised by the dollar's sharp fall
against the yen in New York, although many had expected such a
drop to happen eventually.
    Institutional investors are expected to sell the dollar
aggressively if it rises to around 143.50 yen, dealers said.
    The U.S. Currency steadied well above 143.00 yen after Bank
of Japan intervention and scattered short-covering, they said.
    The dollar opened at 1.5120/30 Swiss francs against

state buying agency EPAC taking part in cereals import tenders
open to private traders will remain unless it is reversed in

EPAC should be eligible, saying it had taken no view in the

1990.

rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers
Association spokesman said.
    The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but
rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are
needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay
regions, he said from Brisbane.
    Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state
and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very
good after heavy falls this month, he said.
    The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what
effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which
is harvested from around June to December.
    He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are
short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need
about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to
restore normal moisture to the cane.
    But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial
to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.
    ""It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it
might be in a month without some good falls,"" he said.

14030,THATCHER FIRM AS PRESSURE MOUNTS FOR ELECTIONS,"As pressure mounted on British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher to call a June election, she said
today that the decision on when to go to the county was hers
and hers alone.
    She was speaking to parliament after senior members of the
ruling Conservative Party urged her to call elections due in
June 1988 a year early in the wake of two more opinion polls
giving her party a commanding lead.
    Asked by a Conservative back-bencher for an assurance that
the decision was hers alone, and did not depend on ""media hype,
pressure and speculation,"" she replied: ""The date of the next
election will be decided by Downing Street, not Fleet Street.""
    Downing Street is the Prime Minister's official residence,
Fleet Street the traditional home of the British national
press.
    A Harris poll for the breakfast-time program TV-AM gave the
Tories 43 pct of the vote, representing a majority of 132 seats
in parliament, their biggest lead since the party's landslide
victory in the 1983 elections.
    In The Times of London, a MORI poll gave the Tories a 92
seat majority. It was the sixth poll to show the ruling party
with a big lead over the opposition Labour Party and the
fast-improving centrist Alliance.
    Leading the chorus urging Thatcher to go to the polls in
June, Sir Marcus Fox, vice-chairman of the influential 1922
committee of Conservative back-benchers, said: ""I have always
felt that it would be June, and this reinforces my view.
    ""I always thought June was right. We have got most of our
legislation through and to go beyond that I do not think would
be in the national interest.""
    Another Tory back-bencher, Anthony Beaumont-Dark, said: ""I
have always been an October man, but I think it would be good
to get it out of the way now.""
    Their comments came as government officials dismissed
speculation about a snap election to coincide with local polls
in May, timed to reap maximum advantage from the recent
popularity surge, Thatcher's successful trip to Moscow and
Labour's current popularity slump.
    Calls for a May poll were also prompted by Tory concern
over a steady advance by the Alliance, and the possibility that
if it continues it could rob the Conservatives of an overall
majority in parliament.
    Today's MORI poll showed an Alliance gain of eight points
over the past month in around 100 key marginal seats where the
outcome of the next election is likely to be decided.

indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage
in its development and recent reports of heat stress could
reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.

department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87
(Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct
from the previous year.
    The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a
period of severe droughts, which at one point required South
Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it
said.
    Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing
increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.
    But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available
supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the

3942,OREGON LUMBER COMPANY TO SELL WOOD TO IRAQ,"A Portland-based wood
products company has signed a 13 mln dlr contract with the
Iraqi government to supply finished softwood lumber to Iraq,
Edward Niedermeyer, president of Niedermeyer-Martin Co said
yesterday.
    Niedermeyer told the House Foreign Affairs sub-committee on
International Economic Policy and Trade in Washington that the
sales agreement contains an option that could make lumber
exported worth more than 20 mln dlrs.
    The delivery of about 8.0 mln dlrs worth of plywood, in
addition to lumber, hinges on whether the U.S. Department of
Agriculture will interpret plywood as an agricultural commodity
under the credit guarantee program, he said.
    Niedermeyer said the government export credit guarantee
program (GSM-102) administered by the USDA was the key to
opening the Iraqi market which up to now had been captured by
Scandinavian lumber producers.
    ""This is the first time we have been able to sell wood
products in Iraq, he said. Without the USDA program it would
not have been possible. We hope this will lead to a long term
export market for U.S. lumber products.""
    He said the contract calls for supplying 21 mln board feet
to 30 mln board feet of softwood lumber for housing,
construction and furniture manufacturing. He estimated the
profit potential for his company on the sale at five to six
pct.
    Niedermeyer spent two weeks in Baghdad negotiating the sale
late last month and early March. He is a member of the United
States-Iraq Business Forum, a non-profit group designed to
promote commerce with Iraq.
    The forum members include Westinghouse and General

15763,GERMAN BANKER CALLS FOR MORE TAX CUTS,"A further cut in West German taxes to
overcome the current weakness of the domestic economy has been
called for by Thomas Wegscheider, management board chairman of
Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG.
    He said in  an interview due in tomorrow's Die Welt
newspaper that tax cuts already decided by the government
should be expanded by implementation of the ""Stability Law,""
which allows tax cuts of up to 10 pct for a limited period.
    Wegscheider also said a temporary rise in state borrowing
resulting from such cuts would be tolerable, according to
excerpts of his remarks released early by Die Welt.
    In line with a pledge made at the Paris monetary conference
in February, the government announced in March that 5.2 billion
marks worth of tax cuts would be added on to reductions of some
nine billion marks already scheduled for next year.
    Wegscheider said the Bundesbank should pursue its policies
aimed at lower interest rates and said a reduction in money
market rates could encourage private capital market investment.
    Earlier today the Bundesbank's vice-president Helmut
Schlesinger said the central bank saw no current reason to

sharply this morning after analyst Daniel Lee of Drexel Burnham

    McDonald's, an operator of fast food restaurants, rose
1-5/8 to 77-3/8.
    ""Comparable store sales are up 5.6 pct in 1986 vs 1985,""
Lee said, ""and the stock is trading below the market multiple.""
He said ""not many companies have a consistent 15 pct annual
earnings growth rate, return on equity above 20 pct, but trade
at less than the market multiple.""
    Analyst Lee said ""the introduction of a new line of salads
this spring, at about the time we are all trying to squeeze
into bathing suits, should boost sales.""
    He also noted that ""the average McDonald's does about 1.369
mln dlrs in revenues a year. That compares with 1.1 mln dlrs a
year for the average Burger King and 800,000 dlrs a year for
the average Wendy's."" Since it cost about the same to build a
single store for any one of these chains, he said, ""McDonald's
can well justify their expansion.""
    Lee expects McDonald's to earn 4.40 dlrs a share in 1986
and 5.15 dlrs in 1988. Last year it earned 3.72 dlrs a share.

little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing
troops from the country's main oil installations occupied three
days ago.
    The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company
Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil
industry employees.
    Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the
withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was
calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their
willingness to negotiate a pay deal.
    A national seamen's strike, however, continued and marines
remained in the country's main ports. The marines were
despatched to the ports after the seamen's strike, now two
weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday.
    A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135
in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports.
    Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport
of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their
seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase.
    Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a
sign that the national strike could soon come to an end.
    Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union
leaders said the vast majority of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were
still on strike.
    The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared
today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the
company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de
Janeiro next Wednesday.
    Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator.
    Besides industrial troubles, there has also been
considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector.
    On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies
throughout the country to protest against high interest rates.
    Television reports showed some of these protests still
continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their
vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and
Parana.
    The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to
extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a
deterioration in its trade balance.
    On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil
was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to
private banks.
    Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and
the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange.

purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
are likely to follow, securities analysts said.
    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses
is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
position, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growing
capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
financial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described
by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give
Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business
sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
management, market research, and consulting on financing.
    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the
world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life
insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
instruments.
    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
problem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going for
blue-chip organisations,"" he said.
    ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
industries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With a
historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.""
    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
to 18 pct, he said.
    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
spread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatory
environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products
in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
fund management,"" Smithson said.

winter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week ended
March 14, moistening topsoils for wheat, just breaking dormancy

Plain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in the

     Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu, Anhui,
eastern Hebei, Hunan , Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zheziang, reversed
February's below normal precipitation pattern.

18911,BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING,"A trade-led boom in the U.S. is
unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will
merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and
other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its
latest economic report.
    Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,
after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will
contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.
    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5
pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,
the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.
    ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop
dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause
a falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said.
    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8
pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.
    The report was released before the Commerce Department
reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,
after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal
consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with
a 0.6 pct increase the month before.
    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost
consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9
pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.
    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income 
growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.
    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power
of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs
this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.
    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing

16183,TEXACO &lt;TX> EUROBONDS UNQUOTED AT MARKET OPENING,"Eurobonds for Texaco Inc subsidiaries
were unquoted this morning as traders assessed the implications
of the company's shock weekend decision to file for bankruptcy
under Chapter 11 of U.S. Bankruptcy laws, eurobond dealers
said.
    The decision to file for bankruptcy follows a court
decision that it had to post an 11 billion dlr bond to continue
its court battles with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
    One head trader at a U.S. Securities house said, ""I don't
want to be obstructive, but there genuinely is no market in
Texaco bonds at the moment. Everyone is stunned by the decision
(to file for bankruptcy) and can't really believe it.""
    One dealer noted that Texaco subsidiaries have outstanding
eurobonds totalling over three billion dlrs out of total
borrowings of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
    He added that many of the fixed interest eurobonds - dollar
straights - had been trading ""basis only"" for some time prior to
this weekend's news. This means traders could quote a two way
price for the bonds but would not be bound to trade them. Any
trades would be negotiated.
    He said that recently there appeared to have been some
speculative buying of the bonds from the U.S. But that European
investors had been overall sellers.
    Dealers noted that under the Chapter 11 filing noteholders
will receive no interest payments.
    Texaco also has eurobonds outstanding which are convertible
into Texaco Inc common stock - known as convertibles. Trading
did not open in these issues either. One convertible dealer
said, ""We're waiting to see the result of today's court hearing.""
Texaco is applying today in the Texas courts for relief from
having to post the court bond.
    Texaco shares were being indicated by over the counter
share dealers here at around 26 to 28 dlrs compared with
Friday's close in New York of 31-7/8 dlrs.
    Pennzoil shares were indicated at 85 to 87 dlrs compared
with Friday's New York finish of 92-1/4 dlrs.

    USX senior debt was lowered to DP-11 (high BB) from DP-9
middle BBB), Marathon oil senior debt to DP-11 from DP-9,
United States Steel senior debt to DP-11 from DP-9 and

domestic integrated producers have lost share to imports and
minimills, D and P said. In oil and gas, profitability and cash
flows are larger, but there is still considerable volatility.
As for financial risk, USX has arranged to borrow 1 billion

ICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and

delegates said.
    ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what
some delegates called a ""pre-compromise"" and present it to the
buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said.
    While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a
buffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated they
were willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said.
    ""I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement --
maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the
session,"" a consumer delegate said.
    Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of
ICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various
grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades,
delegates said.
    Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be
able to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for
the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin.
    Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the
buffer stock should operate, with several countries backing
different aspects of the producer stance, delegates said.
    The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until

    Glaverbel offered the shares at 1,850 francs in an
operation under which its parent company, Asahi Glass Ltd

    Asahi is selling 500,000 shares in Glaverbel while the
company itself is issuing 340,000 new shares. Over 10 pct of
the total available shares has been reserved for staff.
    The statement said applicants for over 5,000 shares will
receive 30. There is a sliding scale which gives relatively
modest applications a higher proportion and those who sought
between 101 and 500 shares will receive five. No shares will be
given to applicants for fewer than 100 shares.
    Glaverbel's net consolidated profit rose to 542 mln francs
last year from 137 mln in 1985 and the group is to pay a 29
franc gross dividend, its first for over 10 years.
    As a result of the offer, some 45 pct of Glaverbel's

    Share dealers said some of the weakness on the bourse
recently probably has been due to the amount of money tied up

farmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for
the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of
10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain

    Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in

rental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpin
new crop futures, they said.
    New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a

yielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest
decrease in final production figures, since farmers will
concentrate on high yielding land.

sugar tender represent a further concession to producers'
complaints that they are losing money on exports outside the
bloc, trade sources said.
    They said the maximum rebate of 45.678 European currency
Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos was 0.87 Ecus below what producers
claim is needed to obtain the equivalent price to that offered
for sales into intervention.
    The rebate at last week's tender was 1.3 Ecus short of the
level producers thought necessary and that of the previous week
was 2.5 Ecus below this level.
    But the sources said producers who have offered a total of
854,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention in an apparent
attempt to persuade the Commission to set higher maximum
rebates have given no formal indication to the Commission that
they intend to withdraw these offers.
    The French and German operators involved would be able to
withdraw the offers up to five weeks after April 1 when the
sugar will officially enter intervention stores.
    The five-week period is the normal delay between sugar
going into intervention and payment being made for it.
    EC officials have said that if the Commission has to buy
the sugar, it is determined immediately to resell it, a move
which could drive down market prices further.

achieve any breakthrough in debt talks here last night after
Brazil refused to say when it would resume interest payments.
    Central Bank governor Francisco Gros said after a meeting
with a 14-bank advisory committee that Brazil cannot make any
interest payments at this time, though it would do so ""as soon
as we can.""
    The talks came as the annual meeting of the 44-nation
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), in which both Gros and
the bankers had been taking part, moved toward a close here.
    Bankers leaving the meeting with Gros declined to discuss
details of the talks, though some expressed satisfaction that
Brazil had agreed to continue working with the committee.
    At the same time, Gros told reporters not to expect any
dramatic developments before March 31, the date when some U.S.
banks have said they will take a decision whether to put Brazil
loans on a non-performing basis.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlr
foreign debt to commercial banks on February 20 and shortly
after announced it was freezing some 16 billion dlrs in
short-term credit lines.
    Banks are not obliged to declare these loans non-performing
before 90 days have elapsed, but the move to announce a
possible decision in this respect was viewed as a means of
exerting pressure on Brazil.
    The bank committee, headed by Citibank, had been pressing
Brazil to make at least a token payment of interest but Gros
said this was not possible right now.
    ""We are not in a position to make a payment at this stage,""
Gros said.
    At the same time, the two sides reached a stopgap
arrangement on the short-term trade and money-market credit
lines, whereby the committee agreed to transmit a Brazilian
request to extend the lines for 60 days until May 31.
    Banks have been indicating they will not renew credit lines

Steel Metallurgy Association, the official Tanjug news agency
said.
    The association groups together the main Yugoslav iron and
steel enterprises.
    Extraction of iron ore should show an annual growth rate of
nine pct and reach seven mln tonnes by 1990 under the program.
Iron output is planned to grow at eight pct a year, reaching
4.5 mln tonnes at the end of the decade.
    Tanjug said the programme would create conditions for
raising exports of finished steel products.
    The main Yugoslav steel producers plan to market 5.35 mln
tonnes of steel goods this year, or 150,000 tonnes more than
last year, with 1.5 mln tonnes going to export.

15975,USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT,"U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln
tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior
week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.
Agriculture Department said.
    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the
department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
buyers.
    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the
four-week average, it said.
    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with
purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.
    Other significant purchasers for the current year were
Mexico and Honduras, it said.
    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
purchasers, the department said.
    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
Department said.
    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200
bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88
season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level
but nine pct below the four-week average.
    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed
by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.

11074,BASS GROUP EMERGES AS POSSIBLE TAFT&lt;TFB> BIDDERS,"The Bass Group, once thought by
analysts to be eager to sell its holdings in Taft Broadcasting
Co, emerged as another potential bidder for the Ohio
broadcasting company.
    The Bass Group, which holds 24.9 pct of Taft, said it had
talked with other taft stockholders and some company managers
and directors ""concerning participation in a group to acquire
control"" of the company.
    The Bass group said it had talks with other Taft
stockholders and members of Taft management about participating
in a group to acquire control. The group, which is led by the
wealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identify
any of the other people with whom it had talks.
    Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman
Dudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion
dlr offer for the company.
    At the time, the company said it authorized its adviser,
Goldman, Sachs and Co, to explore other takeover proposals and
to supply financial data to other interested bidders.
    ""If indeed, the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president
is because the bass group tossed him out, I couldn't see them
backing him on any deal,"" said one analyst, who asked not to be
identified.
    ""I think they wanted a way out. Now, this sounds like
they're going to join the group and buy themselves out,"" said
Edward Atorino, media analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
and Co.
    Analysts have speculated that Carl Lindner may be
interested in acquiring the company. they speculated he may be
one of the shareholders in talks with the bass group.
    Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp, holds 16.2
pct of Taft. He was not immediately available for comment.
    Analysts have said they are baffled by the strength of
Taft's stock price compared to what they see as breakup values
for the company.
    Several analysts had estimated a break up value of less
than 150. One analyst said he believes it has a breakup value
of 160 to 165 dlrs per share.

were not available for comment on market rumors that it is
interested in acquiring Reed International plc &lt;REED.L>.
    Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
adviser, declined comment.
    A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said
the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has
announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover
attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell.""It's completely
inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they
drop the recapitalization,"" he said.
    Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.
    Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a
U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a
declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011
in light of the recapitalization.
    Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon
Brothers Inc &lt;SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the
case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount
of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and
Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face
amount, Harcourt said.
    Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the
court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,
they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.
    Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not
required to issue common to debenture holders who did not
convert prior to June eight.
    An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed
by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors
that Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in New

5273,SAUDI OIL MINISTER SEES NO NEED TO ALTER PACT,"Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
said OPEC's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18
dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there
was no immediate need to change it.
    Nazer, in an interview with Reuters and the television news
agency Visnews, said Saudi Arabia was producing around three
mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, well below its OPEC
quota.
    Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will
continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members
adhere to the pact, Nazer said.
    The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production
ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices
averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.
    Nazer, in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki
Yamani last October, said: ""I do not foresee any need for new
measures before the 25th of June when our (next OPEC) meeting
will take place as scheduled.""
    Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all
members were abiding by its agreements.
    ""We've heard news every now and then of violations but they
were not at all verified,"" he said.
    OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a
13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near
18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact.
    Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but
have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as
traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline.
    Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its
4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price.
    ""As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as
devised in December, Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to
the agreement,"" he said.
    Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the
Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait, but not sales from floating
storage, Nazer said.
    King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, in an interview with Reuters and
Visnews on March 11, said the kingdom wanted oil price
stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful
competition with OPEC.
    ""Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly
desires price stability,"" he said.
    Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had
returned to a role of ""swing producer"" within OPEC.
    Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln
bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and
over-production by some OPEC states.
    ""Saudi Arabia is not playing that role. It is being played
by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8
mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other
members of OPEC,"" Nazer said.
    Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third
quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd.
    But he said if circumstances changed ""I am sure then the
OPEC members will consult with each other and take the
necessary measures.""
    Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when
demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern
hemisphere spring and summer.
    Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation
from non-OPEC producers. Norway, Egypt and the Soviet Union
agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after
he visited them on OPEC's behalf earlier this year.
    ""We did not ask any country to do anything. These were
programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market
conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing
conditions,"" Nazer said.
    He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate
-- such as Britain -- to come up with their own proposals if
they saw fit.",crude

3432,AUSTRALIAN WAGE RISE SET AT 10 DLRS A WEEK,"The Arbitration Commission awarded
the Australian workforce a flat 10 dlrs a week wage increase
and allowed trade unions to begin bargaining for a second-tier
increase of up to four pct, Commission President Justice Barry
Maddern said here.
    The decision is effective from the next pay period of
individual employers, he said in delivering the Commission's
National Wage Case decision.
    Full-time adult ordinary time weekly earnings are 453.00
dlrs a week for males and 428.40 dlrs for all adults, according
to latest official statistics.
    The wage decision is the first under the previously
announced two-tier system which replaced the concept of wage
indexation. It is the first national wage rise since a
partially-indexed increase of 2.3 pct was awarded by the
Commission last July.
    The decision is a compromise between the Federal
government's call at the Wage Case hearing for a 10 dlr weekly
rise plus a three pct second-tier ceiling and the Australian
Council of Trade Unions' (ACTU) claim of 20 dlrs and up to four
pct.
    Employer groups had sought no rise at all.
    The Commission is willing to convene another Wage Case in
October to establish if another wage increase of up to 1.5 pct
should be awarded, Maddern said.
    He said the success of the new system depended on the
commitment of all parties - employers, unions and governments.
    He said the Commission had rejected employers' calls for a
freeze on overall labour cost increases.
    ""We do not think that such an outcome is feasible, given the
needs and expectations of wage and salary earners,' he said,
adding a freeze could have destroyed the possibility of a
cooperative effort to lift Australia's economic performance.
    The decision would ensure the effects of the depreciation
of the Australian dollar and the adverse terms of trade would
not be reflected in wage increases, Maddern said.
    If necessary, it would arbitrate second-tier claims at an
implementation rate of no more than two pct from September this
year and a further two pct from July 1988, he said.
    He said labour cost rises would be phased in over the life
of the package, adding that second-tier rises will be mainly
achieved by a restructuring and efficiency principle, covering
elimination of restrictive work practices, improved efficiency
and productivity and reduction of demarcation disputes.
    Maddern said the Commission again ruled out claims for a
cut in weekly working hours below 38 and allowed employers to
be exempted from wage case decisions on the basis of severe or
extreme economic adversity.
    The Commission said the poor economic outlook noted in its
last decision had persisted, and was perhaps now more serious.
    ""The prevailing uncertainty and lack of confidence in the
economy which underlines the economic circumstances must be
allayed to halt further decline and to turn the economy around.
In this connection, what happens to labour costs is of critical
importance,"" he said.

Demands for greater access to the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) as
trade tensions between the two countries mounted.
    British consumer affairs minister Michael Howard told
reporters he was dissatisfied with the exchange's response to
Britain's non-negotiable timetable for increased British
membership and warned of possible reprisals in the future.
    He described his meeting with Tokyo stock exchange (TSE)
head Michio Takeuchi, in which he demanded greater exchange
access, as ""very frank indeed.""
    In a separate press conference, TSE President Michio
Takeuchi said the exchange has done its utmost to liberalise
its membership and called on Britain to make some concessions.
    According to Takeuchi, Howard wants three British firms to
be named members of the Tokyo stock exchange by the end of this
year. Neither Takeuchi nor Howard would name the companies.
    ""Next May is the earliest possible date for opening our
membership and I want the British government to understand
this,"" Takeuchi said.
    Membership cannot be increased before space on the trading
floor is expanded in May 1988, he said.
     Howard told reporters that was not good enough and said
that Britain would use its powers to ban Japanese financial
institutions from London if it was not satisfied with Tokyo.
    Japan has until the next meeting of senior officials from
the two countries in May or June to come up with a postive
response to the British timetable or face retaliation, he said.
    ""The timetable was constructed in a way that made it a very
reasonable request and I expect it to be met,"" he said.
    Asked about the exchange's argument that it has no floor
space to expand membership, Howard replied, ""We find it very
difficult in our country to understand why the considerable
ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Japanese (in world
markets) is unable to overcome problems of that kind.""
    While here, Howard said he also expressed frustration with
the huge trade imbalance with Japan and with Tokyo's handling
of demands by Britain's Cable and Wireless for a greater role
in Japan's telecommunications business.
    According to Japanese newspaper reports, at least some of
that message may have penetrated.

19456,ARGENTINA'S ALFONSIN MEETS IMF CHIEF CAMDESSUS,"Argentine President Raul Alfonsin
met for more than an hour with International Monetary Fund
Managing Director Michel Camdessus, and Argentine economy
minister Juan Sourrouille said the two men discussed
Argentina's economy and its commercial bank financing package.
    Sourrouille told reporters that 91.5 pct of the 1.95
billion dlr loan, which forms the core of the package, has been
subscribed.
    Citibank, the chairman of Argentina's bank advisory
committee, said yesterday that subscriptions totalled about 91
pct.
    The IMF has said that a ""critical mass"" of bank commitments
is needed before it will start disbursing the 1.83 billion dlr
standby loan that it has approved in principle for Argentina.
    Asked what the IMF has stipulated as a critical mass,
Sourrouille said, ""That has not been defined but anywhere over
90 pct we are doing fine.""
    Although most of the money has been subscribed, officials
noted that about a third of Argentina's 350 creditor banks hold
93 pct of its debt. They are worried that it might take a long
time to persuade the other banks to join the deal.
    Monetary sources said Alfonsin and Camdessus, who had not
met before, mostly discussed Argentina's political and economic
situation. Alfonsin, who is beginning a four-day private visit
to the U.S., was in Philadelphia to speak to the private World
Affairs Council, a non-partisan body dedicated to increasing
public awareness of international affairs.
    In his speech, Alfonsin said economic integration is the
only way for Latin America to overcome its current crisis.
    ""This (economic integration) is probably the most audacious
challenge facing Latin America this century, perhaps the most
audacious of our history,"" he said.

13908,U.S. CALLS FOR GREATER GATT CHECKS ON TRADE,"The United States has appealed for
stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT) to enforce world trade rules.
    The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith
at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows
a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by
the 93-nation body to promote fair trade.
    Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round
launched by ministers last September. The round, which covers
13 areas of trade in agriculture, manufactured goods and
services will take four years to negotiate.
    Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank. He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to
ensure the success of the Uruguay Round.
    ""The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to
assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the
world trading system and the global economy,"" Smith said.
    ""Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak,
or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy.""
    He also also urged that member states be accountable to
each other for their trade policies.
    Smith, who flies to Brussels today for talks with European
Community (EC) officials, told Reuters the committee wanted to
stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics.
    ""We are interested in more periodic ministerial
involvement...Whether in formal or informal meetings,"" he said.
    GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the
12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on
semiconductors. The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade
rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese
chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute
panel be set up to review the agreement.
    President Reagan, who strongly supported the Uruguay trade
round to promote freer trade, has said Washington will impose
tariffs against Japanese electronic goods.
    He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets
to U.S. Exports.

10470,GALACTIC &lt;GALCF> ADOPTS CONSERVATIVE ACCOUNTING,"Galactic Resources
Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said
it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to
other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs.
    As a result, the company retroactively charged all past
exploration and related administration costs incurred on its
properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.
    Under the new policy, all future exploration and related
administration costs will be written off to expenses rather
than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.
    Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln
U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately
disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.
    The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely
affect working capital position, future cash flows or the
company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it
said.
    Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of
costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln
U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other
mine developments.
    Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the
Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the
life of the mine and charged against future earnings.
    The change will also result in lower depreciation and
amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an
ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total
estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.
    Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is
expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent
production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000

Central Bank to the commercial banks fell 1.01 billion guilders
to 9.5 billion guilders in the week ending March 30, the Bank's

    Dealers said payments by the Dutch state, partly in the
form of civil service wages, had outweighed payments to the
State, causing the money market deficit to ease.

item on the weekly return indicated normal commercial foreign
exchange business rather than intervention by the Central Bank.

intervention.

17306,EMS INTERVENTION SAID SOMETIMES COUNTERPRODUCTIVE,"Attempts to hold currency rates
rigidly within tight ranges through European Monetary System
intramarginal intervention can be counterproductive, bringing
funds into the stronger currency from the weaker at rates still
considered fairly favourable, the Bundesbank said.
    ""The movements thus sparked can actually promote the weaker
tendency of a currency, requiring still larger obligatory
intervention when rates hit band limits,"" it said in its 1986
annual report. The other danger was that money supply expansion
could be caused in the stronger currency nation without its
central bank being involved in the activity.

    ""For this reason, currency levels should be allowed as much
room for manoeuvre as possible inside the band limits when a
currency is in a phase of weakness,"" the Bundesbank said.
    ""In addition, speculative positions are made more expensive
to hold when interest differentials are increased.""
    In the report, the Bundesbank gave a rare glimpse of the
extent of intramarginal and obligatory EMS intervention that
has taken place since the foundation of the eight-currency
system on March 13, 1979.

    Obligatory intervention is that required by EMS central
banks when a currency reaches its agreed limit against another
participating unit.
    Intramarginal intervention is undertaken on agreement
between central banks when speculative pressure moves a
currency in an unwanted direction, although it may not yet be
near any allowed EMS limits.
    At the start of this year, central banks were very actively
selling marks and supporting weaker currencies, primarily the
French franc, as speculative EMS pressure grew.

    But the announcement by the Bank of France that it was
ceasing intramarginal intervention sent the franc straight to
its then-permitted floor of 31.8850 marks per 100.
    Data in the Bundesbank report showed the EMS central banks
bought a net total 29.9 billion marks after the April 6, 1986
realignment until the selling petered out on July 7.
    But this was far outweighed by net purchases between July
8, 1986, and the realignment on January 12 this year totalling
63.0 billion marks - 44.1 billion of which was intramarginal
and 18.9 billion was obligatory intervention.

    The data showed that 17.4 billion marks of the total
eventually filtered into the West German monetary system.
    Since the latest realignment, central banks have bought
16.1 billion marks in intramarginal intervention, the
Bundesbank said, without naming the banks involved.
    Only very high activity after the March 21, 1983
realignment came close to matching moves up to last January.
Then, central banks bought a massive 61.6 billion marks in the
period up to July 1985, mainly to stabilise the EMS as the
dollar surged.
    This then turned into mark sales of a net 34.0 billion from
July 11, 1985 in the run-up to the April 1986 realignment.

    He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a

August.
    Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to

    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline

     Michael German, an economist with the American Gas
Association, said while a significant amount of gas was now
replacing oil in dual-fuel boilers, the progress of expanding
the marketshare of gas was slow. First quarter natural gas
consumption data is not available until June.
    In the first three months of 1987, residual fuel demand
fell by an average of 55,000 barrels per day, according to the
American Petroleum Institute. Natural gas, however, was not
able to take full advantage of the decline in oil consumption.
    AGA's German said that while industrial consumers were
concerned with regulatory issues in their long-range capital
investment decisions, in the dual-fuel boiler market relied on
spot purchases.
    ""With all the capability of switching (from oil to natural
gas) already there, price of the fuel is the only concern,"" he
said, adding that compared with the same period last year,
January natural gas price at burner tip is 16 pct lower for
industrial users and 32 pct lower for utilities.
    German attributed the sluggish performance of natural gas
to lower demand in the utility sector as a whole.
    ""March was warmer than normal, which cut down gas
consumption not only in home heating but also in electricity
generation,"" he said.
     In March, according to API monthly statistics, residual
fuel deliveries fell by 13.6 pct to 1.2 mln barrels per day
from the same period a year ago.
    While API specifically mentioned lower natural gas prices
had put residual fuel at a price disadvantage among electric
utilities and industrial users, industry analysts believed the
role of natural gas was over-stated.
    Makovich of DRI noted much of the decline in oil in the
fuel mix was taken up by new nuclear capacity coming on stream
in the last few years.
    Nuclear capacity rose nine pct in 1986, and he projected
the same rate of growth for 1987 and 11 pct growth in 1988. 
    In contrast, oil and gas together represented only 15 pct
of the fuel mix in 1986 and should decline to 13 pct by 1989,
he said. Within this sector, gas share fell to 66 pct in 1986
from 76 pct a year ago due to competition from falling oil
prices, he added. But this year, gas was expected to recapture
only two pct of the share, Makovich said.
    Michael German of AGA agreed and said, ""Nevertheless,
outlet for several hundred billion cubic feet of gas a year is
significant in a glutted market.""

9651,FARM CREDIT SYSTEM TO ASK FOR CONGRESSIONAL AID,"A senior representative of the
financially-troubled U.S. farm credit system is expected for
the first time tomorrow to ask Congress to provide assurances
that stock held by system borrowers will be guaranteed.
    Farm credit sources said Brent Beesley, president of the
Farm Credit Corporation which represents the system, will make
the request at a Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearing.
    They said Beesley would ask Congress to take some action to
assure borrowers the stock is secure. But Beesley is expected
to stop short of requesting other forms of government aid.
    Borrowers from the farm credit system hold some four
billion dlrs in system stock which could be devalued if the
mounting losses of the system persist, officials said.
    Beesley's request expected tomorrow is seen as the first
official acknowledgment from the system itself that federal aid
will be needed to guarantee the value of the stock.
    Yesterday, Jim Billington, a member of the Farm Credit
Administration board which regulates the system, said Congress
should plan to spend at least 800 mln dlrs beginning late this
year to bail-out the system.
    Congress is moving swiftly toward legislation to aid the
system. Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, has drafted a resolution
which would put the Senate on record as guaranteeing the value
of farm credit system stock. The resolution may be brought to
the Senate floor soon, Congressional sources said.
    In addition to requesting a guarantee of borrower stock,
Beesley is expected tomorrow to endorse the creation of a
secondary market, called ""Aggie-mae"" by some proponents, for
the resale of farm real estate loans.
    Sources said the farm credit system will support the idea
if the system is included in the operation of the market.
    Farm credit sources said the system decided to request a
guarantee of borrower stock at a meeting this week in Denver of
the 12 presidents of farm credit system districts.
    Beesley's testimony to the Congressional hearing tomorrow
will not include any new financial forecast of system losses,
officials said.
    Chairman of the FCA, Frank Naylor, yesterday said the
system may lose as much as 1.4 billion dlrs this year.

12399,THAI TRADERS OPPOSE REIMPOSITION OF COFFEE QUOTAS,"Thai coffee exporters said they hoped
the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) would not reimpose
export quotas even though this may lead to a further slump in
world prices.
    Susin Suratanakaweekul, president of the Thai Coffee
Exporters Association, told Reuters that Thailand obtained
little benefit from previous ICO quotas which represented only
about 30 pct of its total annual exports.
    Thailand expects increased overall coffee export revenue if
there are no restrictions on sales to current ICO members who
offer higher prices than non-members, he said.
    The Customs Department said Thailand exported 21,404 tonnes
of coffee last year, up from 20,602 in 1985.
    Thai coffee production is projected to fall to about 25,000
tonnes in the 1986/87 (Oct/Sept) season from 28,000 the
previous year.
    However, a senior Commerce Ministry official said the Thai
government supports coffee producers' lobbying for reimposed
ICO quotas which, he said, would help lift world prices.
    Somphol Kiatpaiboon, director general of the Commercial
Economics Department, said an absence of ICO quotas would
encourage producers to rapidly release coffee on to the market,
further depressing prices.
    He said Indonesia is expected to export a substantial
amount of coffee this month without such restrictions.

2958,FERRY DISASTER MAY RANK AMONG WORST TRAGEDIES,"Fading hope for passengers trapped aboard
a partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could
rank among this centuries' worst peacetime shipping tragedies.
    Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no
hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the
Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian
coast last night.
    If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world's
worst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with
a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the
loss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued.
    The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was
the sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives.
    The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914
when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland
collided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada.
    The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that
took 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was
torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945.
    In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries
sank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and
147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah.

925,CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.,"China called on the United States to
remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
    But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
     The official International Business newspaper today
published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
     ""It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
exports,"" the editorial said.
     ""The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
     ""Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
influences normal trade between the two countries,"" it added
     The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
that ""all kinds of difficulties and restrictions"" were preventing
bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.
     The paper also printed a table showing that, since
bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every
year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits
at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.
     A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept
Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude
goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While
U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.
     He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will
have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several
laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.
     The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,
China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and
Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and ""not be
dominated or controlled by international Communism.""
     The official said China was well aware of the laws, some
of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that
there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change
them.
     China has been the subject of about a dozen cases
involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,
which the U.S. Side won, he said.
     But, for the first time, China signed last week an
agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain
exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may
lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.
     Another diplomat said willingness to provide such
voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in
bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.
     ""China has the potential to disrupt world markets,
especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous
about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other
centralled planned economies in GATT,"" the diplomat said.
     Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of
GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports
or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.
     In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.
Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed
China's interest in participating in GATT.
     ""The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished
overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large
economy of the Chinese type,"" Shultz said.
     ""China can play an important role by actively joining GATT
discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and
enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further
develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum
benefit from its GATT participation,"" he said.
     The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership
are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen
regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially
for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.
     In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT
last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic
system and replacing mandatory instruction with ""guidance
planning"" and economic levers.
     The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to
do.

visit to Argentina, said: ""Debtor and creditor countries have
created this situation jointly. They also share responsibility
for finding lasting solutions.""
    Local officials have payed great importance to
Weizsaecker's visit because they consider him a key backer of
more flexible repayment terms for Argentina's 51 billion dlr
foreign debt, Latin America's third largest.
    Weizsaecker, speaking at a reception held for him by
President Raul Alfonsin at Buenos Aires' City Council hall,
also said no one could overlook the enormity of the obstacle
posed by the foreign debt to countries like Argentina.
    ""Democracy in Latin America must not be endangered because
of misery or new injustices,"" he said.

month if creditor banks did not agree to a new 2.15 billion dlr
loan. An Argentine mission is now in the U.S. For talks with 11
banks, seeking to win an easing of repayment terms and secure
the loan.

European Community over trade barriers and subsidies for grain
exports.
    ""We are making efforts to eliminate them with the help of
balanced interest from all parties,"" he said.

21547,ABE TIPPED TO BE NEXT JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER,"No clear indication has emerged of the
victor in the race to succeed Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone
but political analysts said it was becoming more likely that
former foreign minister Shintaro Abe would be chosen.
    A decision on which of the three contenders would be picked
was expected late today or early on Tuesday, they said.
    Japanese political leaders held a flurry of closed-door
meetings today and the three candidates called on Nakasone, who
is due to step down late this month, to mediate to break the
deadlock.
    The other candidates are Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
and former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita.
    They are vying for the post of president of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who is automatically prime
minister by virtue of the party's parliamentary majority.
    The new LDP president will be named formally at a party
convention on October 30 and elected prime minister by
parliament, probably on November 6, LDP sources said.
    Nakasone, 69, is due to retire on October 31 after five
years in the post, an exceptionally long term by Japanese
standards.
    Takeshita, who is head of the party's largest faction, had
steadfastly opposed the idea of seeking Nakasone's help, but he
told reporters: ""It is possible Nakasone will be given carte
blanche (for selection of his successor).""
    One political analyst, who declined to be identified, said
Nakasone, despite a personal preference for Miyazawa, is likely
to choose Abe as the best candidate for steering Japan through
its international problems and maintaining party unity. Abe
also would also accept Nakasone's influence, he said. Analysts
said one of Nakasone's prime aims is to retain as much power as
possible following his retirement.
    Takeshita, the early favorite because of the size of his
faction, is viewed by many politicians and analysts as being
unsuitable for the post of prime minister because of his lack
of international experience.
    The analysts said Nakasone also was very unlikely to
support Takeshita's bid because of the differences in their
political styles.

7628,JAPAN UNDER ATTACK OVER TRADE SURPLUS,"Japan's economic policies face fierce
international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its
trade surplus, international monetary sources said.
    At a meeting this week in Paris, senior government
officials from major nations are considering an Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff report
that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus, they
said.
    Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the
yen's sharp rise against the dollar, they still tend to surge
when growth picks up, according to the OECD.
    As a solution, the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect
its export-driven economy, boosting domestic demand and imports
by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy, they said.
    That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret
meetings of the International Monetary Fund's executive board.
    The monetary sources said Japan's policy was criticized
when the board met to consider the country's economy under the
annual consultations it holds with each of its members.
    The United States, which until recently has been reluctant
to criticize Japan's fiscal stance, joined in the attack, he
said.
    The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese
government's forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal
year beginning April 1. Most independent forecasters, including
the IMF, believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below
three pct, monetary sources said.
    The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to
such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic
pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen's rise. The
yen's climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge
American market.
    Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further
yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus, which last
year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs.
    Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen, Foreign
Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently. The yen closed here
today at 151.53 to the dollar. Most Japanese politicians,
including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, are clearly hoping
the yen will weaken, government officials said.
    At a meeting in Paris last month, Britain, Canada, France,
Japan, the United States and West Germany, agreed to cooperate
to hold currencies at around current levels.
    Officials said that wording represented a compromise.
Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few
months, before it weakens later in the year.
    Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value
for the dollar, perhaps by substituting the word ""recent"" for
""current,"" while the United States wanted it to more clearly
point to the dollar's weaker levels now, perhaps by use of the
word ""present,"" they said.
    In the months leading up the February 22 agreement, the
dollar dropped some 10 yen.
    The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the
market that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar from
rising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for
the U.S. Currency.
    Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts, which it says do
not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese
economy that will be triggered by the strong yen.
    Officials said there are already signs of that. More and
more companies have announced plans to move production
facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad,
they said.

1920,HUGHES TOOL DIRECTORS REJECT MERGER WITH BAKER,"The directors of Hughes Tool Co
&lt;HT> said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject
a merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO> today.
    Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation
would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M.
Local time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger.
    Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger
but decided against it.
    The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice
requirement that Baker sell off several specialised
subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling.
    The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel
the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement.
    The board of directors of the California-based Baker had
approved the merger. On February 17 Baker said it had signed an
agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries.
    The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with
the Justice Department requirement, Kerridge said.

9206,SWIRE EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH THIS YEAR,"Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> expects
continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees
problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.
    He told reporters:""1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific
Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire
Properties expects further good results both from properties
under development for sale and from its investment property
portfolio.""
    He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The
company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78
billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.
    Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs
mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG>.
    Miles said the company will use the money to develop its
business, primarily in Hong Kong.
    Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from
70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25
pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the
enlarged capital to the state-owned &lt;China International Trust
and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986
profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.
    Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's
flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.
    He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of ""a
marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with
savings in fuel costs.""
    ""At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable
for the rest of this year,"" he said, ""though there might be a bit
of increase later this year.''
    Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service
operations, even though the marine sector is generally
depressed. ""Obviously the marine industry is not getting any
better,"" he said.
    The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year
revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with
an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.
    Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm
but said the firm has no available land for a major housing
project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong
island now near completion.
    He said the company's 50 pct unit &lt;Hongkong United Dockyard
Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of
an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing
estate. ""But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing,"" he said.

    The fire, which started Wednesday and burned for more than

officials said.
    Michel Lefebvre, vice president of operations, said Noranda
will operate the mine at about one-third of its normal 72,000
metric ton annual finished capacity, using above ground
reserves, until it decides whether to keep the mine open.
    ""The events we sustained yesterday and the day before are a
very serious setback for Gaspe Mines operations,"" Lefebvre said.
Gaspe Mines is the name of the Noranda division that operates
the Murdochville mine.
    He said it would take four or five months to bring

11768,ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND,"If we go on using up
farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in
20 years to grow grain on.""
    Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on
the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it
tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same
time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.
    China has to feed one quarter of the world's population,
but only one seventh of its land is arable.
    Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into
a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in
1986.
    But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which
has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for
factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.
    Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of
its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller
amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during
the two years.
    ""We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the
industrialisation began,"" official Xu said. ""Since then, nearly
all the families in the county have built new homes and many
factories have gone up.""
    ""Last year we lost land to a new railway line,"" Xu said. But
land losses in future should fall because nearly all families
already have new houses, she added.
    The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the
Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that
China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land
for the first time this year.
    ""The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,
wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,"" said
an article in the official press explaining the new measures.
    ""It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,"" it
said. ""China has a large population and its land resources are
badly deficient.""
    An official of the Shanghai city government said county
authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of
arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must
be approved by the city government.
   The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its
efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The
prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making
it more profitable for them to grow other crops.
    To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser
and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to
buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to
China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise
grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.
    Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the
problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.
    Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the
eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too
much to the demands of ""selfish city people"" and could raise city
grain prices without any problem.
    But the government has ruled out a price rise. ""Raising the
price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social
stability,"" said a China Daily editorial this month.
    The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the
long term. ""We must be very careful. We have a very large
population which is used to price stability and will object to
price rises,"" he said. ""The problem is how to do it.""
    The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might
also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with
grain and consumed by city residents.
    In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate
investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.
    The official press has reported that farmers fear farm
policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into
building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.
    Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign
contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,
but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.
    ""As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at
the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the
future,"" the China Daily said in an editorial last month.
    Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to
use the land but not own it. For most of the period of
Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where
there was little room for individual initiative.
    ""New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency
of government policies and make them interested in long-term
investment,"" the newspaper said.

20046,THAI STOCKS PLUNGE IN REACTION TO WORLDWIDE TREND,"Thai stock prices plunged on Tuesday as
nervous investors unloaded shares on reports of steep declines
on major world stock markets.
    Brokers said the Securities Exchange of Thailand Index fell
a record 36.64 points, or nearly eight pct, to close at 422.37.
    ""It's impossible to halt the slide in this situation. The
market just doesn't behave logically,"" said Sirivat
Voravetvuthikun, executive vice president of Asian Securities
Trading Co Ltd.
    But Sirivat said he did not believe the fall would mark the
end of the SET's 16 month bull run, which has accelerated
during the last two months. He expected Thai stocks to
fluctuate widely in the next few weeks.
    The slide on Tuesday followed a 13.85 point decline of the
97-stock index on Monday when it closed at 459.01.
    Brokers said they were flooded with sell orders when the
market opened this morning and a SET announcement urging
investors not to panic was ignored.
    The index reached a record 472.86 last Friday, up 57.7 pct
from end-June and 128.2 pct higher than last December.
    SET officials said 77 issues were traded on Tuesday, of
which all but two declined. Of the losers, 68 plummeted the
daily maximum 10 pct allowed by the exchange. Prices on the
special foreign column also fell sharply.
    SET vice president Suthichai Chitvanich told reporters the
10 pct floor serves as a restraint, making it unnecessary to
suspend trading should the panic continue.
    The Thai exchange has lately been gaining on its own
strength with most buying coming from local investors.
    Investors should not be unduly influenced by foreign market
reports, he added.
    Suthichai said sound local fundamentals, including low
interest rates and promising economic growth, favoured
investment in the stock market.
    The SET also announced it would release third quarter
corporate earnings earlier than expected as part of efforts to
shore up public confidence.

    However, it said it had agreed with an earlier draft report
that the accident was caused by incorrect repairs which
remained undetected during scheduled inspections.
    The final report, released today, said faulty repairs to
the plane in 1978 by Boeing and inadequate inspection by
Transport Ministry inspectors caused the 1985 crash, the worst
single air disaster in aviation history.
    Boeing said it did not believe a similar accident could
occur under any foreseeable operating conditions but said it
had made tests and provided equipment for new planes and for
planes already in service to ensure it could not happen again.

1999,U.S. EXPANSION THREATENED - CONGRESSIONAL REPORT,"The U.S. economy is facing several
serious problems which threaten its continued expansion,
according to a Congressional report released today.
    The report by the Democratic majority of the Congressional
Joint Economic Committee said the outlook was for sluggish
growth in the U.S. and the rest of the world for the near
future.
    Committee Republicans released a separate, more optimistic
report predicting continued stable growth with low inflation.
    Democrats have a 12 to eight majority on the committee,
which is made up of 10 Senators and 10 Representatives.
    ""The annual report of the committee surveys a 3.7 trillion
dlr economy whose tranquil appearance obscures the danger
signals that lie just below the surface,"" Committee chairman
Sen. Paul Sarbanes said in a statement.
    ""A close inspection of the economy reveals that the current
recovery, while long, is fragile, and we are skating on thin
ice,"" the Maryland Democrat said.
    He said the danger signals included a decline in
investment, increased demand for borrowing which was straining
the financial system, a possible increase in inflation fueled
by higher oil prices and the depressed condition of the
nation's farmers.
    Republicans said most private economists saw no likelihood
of a recession and were predicting a growth rate of around
three pct for this year and next, similar to Administration
forecasts.
    ""The economy appears to be on a path of stable growth. We're
comfortable with the current low rate of inflation, hopeful
that interest rates will continue to decline, optimistic that
employment opportunities will continue to improve and confident
in this nation's resilient, innovative and diversified economy,""
the Republican report said.
    ""The greatest economic challenge facing the 100th Congress
is reducing the federal deficit,"" the Republicans added.
    Democrats said the budget deficit should be reduced but
also wanted the government to spend more on education, job
training, research and development and health care.
    They said pressures on the dollar might make it difficult
for the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to stimulate the
economy if this becomes necessary.
    ""There is now substantial concern about the inflationary
effects of a declining dollar and the buildup of monetary
pressure arising from the recent rapid growth in the money
supply,"" the Democrat report said.
    ""At the same time, the increased reliance on foreign sources
of capital in American investment markets means that the
Federal Reserve can no longer be as aggressive as in the past
in lowering interest rates and driving the dollar down.""
    ""Taken together, the outlook for fiscal and monetary policy
is thus not very encouraging,"" the Democrats said.
    The Democrats called on the Administration to be more
aggressive in removing foreign trade barriers and in seeking
new initiatives to solve the international debt problem.
    The Democrats said much of the U.S. trade deficit had been
caused by misalignment of the world's currencies, especially
the overvaluation of the dollar that began in 1982.
    Both Democrats and Republicans called for policies to
increase American productivity including incentives for saving
and investment in plant and equipment and development of a
better educated work force.

19505,SAUDI OIL COMPANY GETS NEW ACTING GOVERNOR,"The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's
state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has
retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
    They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
    Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
    The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
post permanently.
    The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
market.
    The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
    Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
last December.
    Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
does business, the sources said.
    The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who
earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of
Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister
Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the
University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi,
Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic

    The company said the debentures are convertible into Ogden

the 2-for-1 stock split distributable on July three.
    A portion of the proceeds will be used to redeem the 50 mln

    The balance of the proceeds is expected to be used in the

company said.
    Ogden also said the potential conversion of the debentures
will not adversely affect its current earnings and cash flow
expectations.

13657,TREASURY'S BAKER TO HOLD TALKS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH,"U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
holds talks with counterparts from Europe and Japan today, to
urge them to carry out commitments in a recent accord to speed
their economic growth.
    Baker is also expected to outline proposals for making
agreements to coordinate economic policies more binding.
    The bilateral discussions foreshadow full-blown talks of
the Group of Five industrial countries joined later by Italy
and Canada to form the Group of Seven.
    The five comprise finance ministers and central bankers of
the United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.
    The Treasury Secretary is expected to see Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson.
    Baker and other finance ministers say they intend to
reaffirm the Paris Agreement to buttress global economic
growth, reduce trade imbalances and stabilize currencies.
    Monetary sources said a short communique to that effect is
expected after the meeting ends.
    These talks form part of this week's semi-annual meetings
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
    At the same time, monetary sources say they expect Baker to
put forward proposals, originally outlined at the 1986 Tokyo
Summit, to tighten procedures for policy coordination.
    Washington wants other major nations to establish specific
policy goals for economic growth, inflation, current account
balance of payments, trade balances, budget performance,
monetary conditions and currencies.
    If actual economic performance veers sharply away from such
objectives, then countries should consult on whether corrective
action is necessary, the proposal says.
    Monetary sources said there was some support for the
proposal, which may not be made final until the Venice Economic
Summit in June, but Britain and West Germany were firmly
against any attempt to make corrective action automatic.
    The U.S. Treasury team, led by Baker, has worked on this
plan since last September, when it won the support of France.
    Baker, meanwhile, will press Japan and West Germany to live
up to their commitments, made over six weeks ago in Paris, to
boost their domestic demand to absorb more imports.
    He is also expected to reassure his counterparts that the
Reagan administration will reach agreement with Congress on a
significant budget deficit cut this year, helping to depress
U.S. demand for imports.
    The aim of the Paris Accord is to redress the huge
imbalance between the trade surpluses of Tokyo and Bonn on the
one hand, and Washington's massive trade deficit on the other.
    Japan, in particular, is under pressure to come up with a
meaningful stimulus package or face a further rise in the yen.
    Financial markets appear to believe the yen should go
higher against the dollar, a development that has become
unacceptable in Japan.
    The Paris Agreement, by the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain and Canada, called for currencies to
be stabilized around current levels.
    But the dollar fell again just several weeks after the
agreement was reached, and its present stability is said to be
temporary as dealers await the outcome of this week's talks.
    Meanwhile, representatives of the leading Third World
countries continue preparing their position for their ministers
to present to industrial nations later this week.
    Monetary sources said the so-called Group of 24 developing
nations are preparing a very tough communique which brands the
western strategy for shoring up the debt strategy as a failure.
    They call instead for vast new assistance from the
industrial world and a much greater role for the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

16504,TURKEY SEEN UNLIKELY TO JOIN EC THIS CENTURY,"Turkey, which tomorrow will formally
apply to join the European Community, faces major obstacles in
its bid and is unlikely to become the bloc's 13th member before
the year 2000, EC officials said.
    Turkey's move comes as no surprise, but some officials said
the application from a relatively poor country with most of its
territory in Asia rather than Europe was likely to spark a long
process of soul-searching among the EC's current members about
what kind of European Community they wanted in the long term.
    Officials echoed the view of diplomats in Ankara that
Turkey's move put the EC in the dilemma of wanting to make
clear it values Ankara as an ally in the NATO alliance, but
sees huge problems in accepting it as a fellow EC member.
    They said industrialised Community members have tried to
dissuade Turkey from making the long-discussed formal
application until the EC had had more time to digest the
accession of Spain and Portugal last year.
    Several also feel Ankara and the EC should first fully
implement a 23-year-old association agreement between them
before Turkey becomes a full member.

8054,DALLAS-BASED THRIFT CLOSED BY REGULATORS,"The Federal Home Loan Bank Board
said Dallas-based Vernon Savings and Loan Association, the 15th
largest thrift in Texas, was closed by state authorities and
its assets, deposits and liabilities were transfered to a new
federally chartered association.
    Vernon, with 1.35 billion dlrs of assets and nine offices
in Texas and Oklahoma, was closed after state regulators
concluded it was in unsafe and unsound condition.
    The thrift was owned by Texas businessman Donald Dixon, who
bought it in early 1982, when it had only 120 mln dlrs in
assets.
    The bank board said growth was accomplished largely through
the purchase of brokered deposits and the sale of jumbo
certificates of deposit, which totaled 29 pct of total deposits
at the end of 1986.
    The bank board also said that 96 pct of its loan portfolio
was nonperforming as a result of sloppy loan practices.
    It said Vernon also paid excessive salaries and dividends
to officers and directors and bought a beach house and five
airplances for the use of thrift executives and stockholders.
    The bank board ousted the thrift's officers and directors
and hired another Texas association to run it.
    The bank board also said it closed First Federal of
Maryland, a federal savings association that had 115.2 mln dlrs
in assets. It said its 118 mln dlrs in insured deposits were
transferred to Columbia First Federal Savings and Loan
Association of Washington, D.C.
    The bank board said First Federal had engaged in unsound
loan underwriting practices and many of the loans are now
deliquent. The institution experienced heavy and continuing
losses and became insolvent, the bank board said.

4871,PROPOSALS TO RELAX U.S. DRUG LAWS POSE PROBLEMS,"The Reagan Administration's soon-to-be
published proposals to make experimental therapies more rapidly
and widely available to terminally ill patients pose product
liability problems for drug companies, experts in the
pharmaceutical field said.
    Details of the proposals will be published in the Federal
Register shortly and will become effective after a 90-day
comment period.
    Under the proposed policy, announced Tuesday by
Commissioner of Food and Drugs Frank E. Young at a press
conference, patients with life threatening diseases who are not
enrolled in clinical trials would be allowed access to an
experimental therapy. The policy also allows drug companies to
sell the promising drugs to patients.
    Previously drugs like AZT could be rushed into wider use
free-of-charge if the agent was shown to be effective. Under
the new policy, the FDA could only refuse to permit a physician
to administer an experimental drug if it was shown to be
unsafe.
    Financial analysts said the plan would likely benefit
biotechnology companies with few or no products approved for
marketing in the U.S., but would have little economic impact on
large drug companies with many other sources of revenue.
    ""Charging a fee for still experimental drugs could help
biotech companies' near-term financial situation and help make
them less dependent on outside sources,"" said Teena Lerner, a
biotech analyst at L.F. Rothchild.
    Other observers were concerned that drug companies would be
put into a legal bind if promising drugs later proved to have
devastating side effects.
    ""Before a lot of drug companies release these drugs they
are going to have to think long and hard about liability--the
product liability problems are enormous,"" said a
Washington-based lawyer who specializes in the drug field.
    Patients in clinical trials normally sign lengthy informed
consent papers before taking an investigational drug. The
lawyer said no more than two cases had gone to trial for suits
against a drug company's investigational drug.
    ""The new proposals are a whole new kettle of fish,"" said
the lawyer. ""Drug companies are right now probably meeting with
their insurance companies.""
    Burroughs-Wellcome Co, the U.S. arm of the British firm
Wellcome PLC that makes AZT, Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>,
Hoffman-LaRoche Inc and SmithKline Beckman Corp &lt;SKB> said it
was too soon to comment on the policy.
    ""I'm very uncomforable with this,"" said Wellcome
spokeswoman Kathy Bartlett. ""We haven't had a chance to
formulate a response yet. It's too early.""
    But some financial analysts say the proposals would benefit
drug companies.
    ""I find the proposal to be a very significant alteration of
the FDA's past policies that should positively affect (drug
companies') stocks,"" said drug analyst Davis Saks, with Morgan,
Olmstead, Kennedy and Gardner.
    Saks also warned that many health care providers would balk
at the proposal, and would call it ""amoral"" to charge patients
with life-threatening diseases for drugs that otherwise would
be given out for free in clinical trials.
    Jeffrey Warren, spokesman for the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, which represents the major drug
firms in the U.S., said ""A mechanism already exists at the FDA
permitting certain seriously ill patients access to
experimental drugs and perhaps that system can be approved.""
    Warren acknowledged that the PMA may not be able to come up
with a consensus among its membership when the rules are
formally published.
    He also admitted that product liability problems could be a
concern to major drug companies.
    Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force, which is actively in AIDS policy and
funding issues, cited the drug Suramin from Bayer AG &lt;BAYRY>,
which had shown early promise as an AIDS treatment, but on
wider clinical testing was shown to have deadly side effects.

the writing of a fiscal 1988 U.S. budget plan.
    Republicans failed to appear at a drafting session called
by Democratic committee chairman William Gray as a make-up

a week and threatens the ability of Congress meeting an April
15 deadline for completing the deficit-cutting budget.

the bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be no
major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than
expected, economists said.
    Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,
compared with no change in January, while consumption
expenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,
reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.

released. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.    
    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc

and salary disbursements in February.
    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the
average workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by
four cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable
goods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at
least 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.
    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond
market much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping
just 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.
    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow

    ""Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bond
market,"" quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co
International Inc.
    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the
steadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some
signs of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations
that inflation will remain subdued.
    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.
    ""It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation
was not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned
that lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five
pct inflation is a real possibility ahead,"" Boltz said in a

19039,CANADIAN TAX REFORM CALLED AN IMPORTANT STEP,"Canada's sweeping tax reform package,
announced today, is an important step towards a fairer system,
but is not as bold a revamp of the tax structure as some had
expected, economists and business leaders said.
    ""It's the biggest step towards tax reform we've taken in a
great many years,"" Merrill Lynch Canada Inc chief economist
Michael Manford told Reuters.
    ""But the system is the same old system with a lot of
important changes, as opposed to a brand new system,"" he added.
(See spotlight index page on ECRA)
    Manford said changes introduced by Finance Minister Michael
Wilson did not go far enough in simplifying the federal tax
system. They represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary
reform.
    ""Overall, I thought that it was a more timid step than we
were led to believe,"" he said.
    Wilson's move to increase money collected from corporations
while cutting individual taxes ""is probably an acceptable shift,""
said Bill James, president of Falconbridge Ltd, an
international mining company.
    Wilson spread corporate tax increases fairly evenly across
the corporate sector, James said. ""So it's not going to hit
anyone too hard and we will remain competitive.""
    Wilson said in his speech to the House of Commons that
Canada's tax system needed to be changed to compete with
sweeping reforms in the United States last year.
    ""The critical thing on the corporate side is that Wilson
moved most of the taxes much closer to the U.S. System,"" Manford
said.
    The federal government increased taxes paid by corporations
by about five billion dlrs over the next five years, but
lowered personal taxes by 11 billion dlrs in the same period.
    Despite collecting more corporate taxes, Wilson was able to
lower the tax rate on individual companies by removing many
special tax exemptions and broadening the tax base.
    Wilson's plan also reduced the capital cost allowance, used
by companies to write off major investments, which some
business spokesmen said will hurt business in the long run.
    ""That will affect some investment decisions negatively,"" said
Laurent Thiebeault, Canadian Manufacturers Association
president.
    Tax analysts said for some industries it will take several
days to assess the impact of the capital cost allowance
reductions that will be made over a number of years.
    As anticipated, Canada's opposition parties signalled they
intend to fight the new tax measures as they are introduced in
Parliament over the next few months.
    ""It's not tax reform, it's a tax grab,"" said Liberal leader
John Turner.
    Turner labelled changes to the federal sales tax ""a money
machine for the minister of finance.""
    Wilson broadened the federal sales tax to include
additional products and also promised to introduce a
broad-based, multi-staged sales tax.
    ""It's not at all a fair package and Canadians are going to

controversial sales tax plan, bowing to widespread opposition
even within his own party.
    The reports said he told a meeting of supporters of his

should be amended if there was anything wrong with it.
    Officials were not immediately available for comment.
    Until now, Nakasone had vowed to press on with the tax as
part of his plan to reform Japan's 36-year-old tax system.
    But most Japanese newspapers and news agencies quoted him
as saying today he would not foist the tax on the Japanese
people if they hated it.
    Opposition parties and some industry groups say the tax
breaks Nakasone general election campaign promises last July
and would discourage consumer spending, needed to meet
government pledges to try to stimulate economic growth.
    Pressure for the tax to be amended or shelved is likely to

April 12, political analysts said. Resistance has spread from
opposition parties and affected industries to the LDP.

Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would
be met by ""a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the
world.""
     U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks
apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do
whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face
of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.
    The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been
told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a
threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.
    U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made
anti-ship ""Silkworm"" missiles, which pose a greater threat to
merchant ships than missiles used before.
    The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended
to attack ships were ""misleading propaganda.""
    He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause
of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use ""all
its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.""
    Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. ""We
are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping
going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very
vital waterway.""
    ""We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what
might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and
listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in
keeping navigation free in that area,"" he said.

not unusual.

improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman
Michael Angus said.
    He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct
after being flat for some years.
    Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating
activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he
noted.
    But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic
acquisitions taking place ""from time to time,"" he said.
    The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax
profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.
In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped
three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
    Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc
&lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
earnings dilution.
    However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
    Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
40 pct by end-1987.
    The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever
Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
the change in attributable profit.
    Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said
that there was no target date for completing the process.
    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had
paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which
operates outside Unilever's core activities.
    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,
considerable expansion in the household products business and
in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
    However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business
had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
of its Surf detergents.

9793,IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED,"Efforts by governments to control wheat
surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial
success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its
latest monthly report.
    Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing
both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC
says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat
exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.
    In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,
which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export
income, there may be problems in reducing production.
    A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to
unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.
Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then
lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.
    The IWC outlines three courses of action open to
governments in wheat exporting countries.
    They could continue to support prices in the hope that when
the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and
surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.
    Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which
could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long
period.
    This option may prove to be the most politically
unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning
wheat production, the report said.
    The third option would be for governments to distinguish
between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,
possibly varying support prices according to farm size or
overall production.
    The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting
countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the
producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.
    These changes did not always result in lower export
subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more
than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.
    For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention
price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European
currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which
most export transactions are denominated, the intervention
price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of
supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers
and some governments are now searching for ways to cut
expenditure, the report says.
    The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five
major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey
from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to
increased production in China and India.
    The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was
countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower
acreages.
    In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per
cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to
other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.
Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

17454,ISRAELI BANK SAYS ELECTION COULD HARM ECONOMY,"Israel's central bank said in its
annual report the country made striking gains in 1986 under an
austerity program, but warned a national election campaign
could harm the economy.
    Elections are due by November 1988, but tension within the
government over a Middle East peace conference has led many
political analysts to predict the government may fall earlier.
    Bank of Israel governor Michael Bruno told a news
conference the austerity since July 1985 had balanced the
national budget for the first time in 15 years, and pushed
inflation from 400 pct a year to just below 20 pct in 1986.
    But Bruno warned that if politicians followed their past
practice of lifting customs duties and increasing government
subsidies on basic goods in order to curry public favour during
elections, the gains of the program could be lost.
    ""The great success of the national unity government in
executing the economic programme ... Depends on its ability to
show proper judgement towards economic issues also when
elections are on the horizon,"" Bruno said.
    He blamed a 12 pct rise in real wages in 1986 for a sharp
increase in private consumption, and said higher pay was
harming attempts to push inflation to under 10 pct a year.
    ""The lowering of inflation was one of the striking successes
of 1986,"" Bruno said.
    ""It is important to note that in this area of economic
stability we still have to tread a delicate path to reach an
annualised inflation rate of 10 pct in the second half of this
year,"" he said. He added that this was achievable.
    The Bank's report said Israel's gross domestic product grew
by 2.2 pct in 1986. The business GDP, which most economists
view as a better indicator of economic growth, rose by 3.7 pct.

8134,AUSTRALIAN OIL TAX CUT SEEN BOOSTING OUTPUT,"A 10 percentage
point reduction in the Australian government's maximum crude
oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output,
resources analyst Ian Story said here.
    A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait
output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels
per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000
BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration
Association annual conference.
    Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney
stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.
    Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer
appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.
    The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered
before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co
Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp &lt;XON> partnership to shut-in
production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing
government revenue, he said.
    He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30
Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs
if the levy was cut to 70 pct.
    ""The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive
at oil prices below 30 dlrs,"" Story said.
    Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher
levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost
exports and provide incentives for exploration and development,
he said.
    The government is currently reviewing the oil tax
structure.

9969,BRAZIL ASKS 60-DAY EXTENSION SHORT-TERM CREDIT,"Brazil today suggested to its foreign
bank creditors an extension of short-term credit lines for 60
days until May 31, a spokesman for the Central Bank said.
    He said that with the move, called a ""standstill""
arrangement, Brazil was only trying to avoid difficulties to
pay its 109 billion dlrs debt in the future.
    The spokesman told Reuters that Brazil's suggestion will be
communicated by telex to Brazil's 700 bank creditors.
    The spokesman declined to give details of what was included
in the statement, but said Central Bank president Francisco
Gros was seeking a 60-day extension of the short-term credit
lines from its commercial bank creditors.
    The amount of these credit lines totals 15 billion dollars,
and deadline for payment is set for March 31.
    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said in a television
interview it was ""absolutely important"" for Brazil and its
creditors to renew the short-term credit lines, as Brazil must
finance its exports.
    ""If these credit lines were cut, we would face difficulties
to honour our foreign debt in the future,"" Funaro said.
    ""There is evidently a common interest in the matter,"" he said.
    Funaro said, however, he was told creditors understand
Brazil's position and do not wish to turn the negotiation for
the renewal of the credit lines more difficult.
    Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68-
billion dlrs debt to commercial banks and froze short-term
trade and money market lines.
    He said Brazil's suggestion is part of its demands ""before
the need to renew the mechanisms of loans in the world.""
    Funaro said currently debt negotiations are ""very complex
and complicated,"" mentioning cases of countries which had to
wait some 10 months before getting a reply from creditors.
    ""We are not interested in confrontation, but we would like
the loan mechanisms to show that the crisis belongs to both
sides,"" Funaro said.
    Funaro denied rumours that he had offered his resignation
to President Jose Sarney.
    ""Who decides whether to keep or dismiss his ministers is the

10103,BANK OF MONTREAL HOPEFUL ON BRAZIL - PRESIDENT,"&lt;Bank of Montreal> is confident a
solution will be found to Brazil's foreign debt problem and is
not considering declaring its Brazilian loans non-performing,
president Grant Reuber said.
    Speaking to reporters after a speech to a Toronto business
group, Reuber said: ""I think at this stage it is really too
early to say very much about (the Brazilian debt situation) but
we're pretty confident that things will work out.""
    He declined to comment on when such a settlement was
likely. Bank of Montreal had 1.98 billion dlrs in loans to
Brazil as of last September 30, the most of any Canadian bank.
     Brazil last month suspended interest payments on its 68
billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.
     Asked if Bank of Montreal were considering declaring its
Brazil loans non-performing, Reuber replied: ""We haven't really
got to that point because we don't think we will have to face
that issue.""
    Some bankers in the U.S. said earlier this week that slow
progress in talks between Brazil and its major foreign lenders
has increased the likelihood that U.S. banks will declare their
Brazil loans non-performing at the end of the quarter.
     Reuber told reporters the bank was still pondering its
strategy regarding possible entry into the securities business
after June 30 when banks and other financial institutions will
be allowed full participation in the Ontario securities
industry.
    He said price would help determine if the bank formed its
own securities unit or acquired an existing investment dealer,
adding that asking prices for some dealers seem ""fairly high.""
    Asked about plans for wholly owned Harris Bankcorp Inc, of
Chicago, Reuber said Harris might consider acquiring more small
community banks around Chicago.
    ""In addition, I think we are giving some consideration to
the possibility of extension into other states,"" Reuber said of
Harris, although he added that any such move was unlikely this
year.
    In his speech, focusing on current free trade talks between
the U.S. and Canada, Reuber said failure to reach a deal would
not represent a calamity for Canada but could lower Canada's
standard of living, raise unemployment and reduce the country's
world trading influence.

    A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total
1987 dividend of four cents per ""B"" share, while the ""A"" share
dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a
share.
    Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986
net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.
    Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from
4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.
    It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson
achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in
most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG>,
Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.
    He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong
Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a
reorganisation, is ""a long term investment and now stands at a
level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset
imbalance.""
    Keswick said the issue of new ""B"" shares will give the group
""the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for
expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which
has been brought about through the group's recent
restructuring.""
    He said the new issue is pending approval from both the
firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate
adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.
    The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation,
with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to

    Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two
companies spun off from Hk Land -- &lt;Mandarin Oriental
International Ltd> and &lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd>
-- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.
    Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs
last year, will become debt free after the restructuring.
    ""A positive cash flow from operations and disposals,
continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,""
Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in
airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking
business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.
    Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its
general trading business in the Middle East in view of the
continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said
the operations would be profitable in the longer term.
    He said the firm's function ""has evolved into one primarily
of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy.""
    He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board
of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific
regional board. He gave no further details of the change.
    Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at

3571,"OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING","OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to
fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an
overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to
defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.
    He told a news conference here ""After due consultation with
my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria
and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold
the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various
quotas and official selling prices.""
    Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.
    ""We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading
news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member
countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the
month of February,"" Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.
    Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at
900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm
determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs
agreed upon last December in Geneva.
    The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for
OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed
prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.
    Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but
fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more
than the agreed level.
    ""The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not
hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of
OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs,"" Lukman
said.
    He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based
on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding
that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000
bpd.
    Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement,
while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab
Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.
    ""If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement
succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level
of 18 dlrs,"" the group's president said.
    He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting
formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.
    ""Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is
at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in
December are being adhered to,"" he said.
    Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow
the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in
relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied ""We consider
the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials.""
    Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn
on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well
below this time last year and soon they would return to the
market in search of crude.
    ""We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in
maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year,""
Lukman said.
    The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he
said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise
prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held
view not to do anything to help the market.
    ""We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with
two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is
ours. We will use that advantage responsibly,"" he said.
    Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output
following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the
South American country would be allowed a higher output quota
when it recovered from the disaster.

based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
quarter.
    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
within its December accord on output and prices.
    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
on the latest oil production cutbacks.
    Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
prices stable.
    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
during the first half of 1986.
    But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
deficit.
     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

dlr transaction Monday.
    Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the
transaction on March 16, as scheduled, if it is approved by
shareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide
before the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change.
    Explaining its request for the amendment, Siemens informed
Telecom it had recently become aware of information causing
concern with respect to certain accounting and other matters.
    Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review
beyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations
and warranties are true.
    Telecom said it advised Siemens it knows of no information
which would make its representations and warranties untrue.
    Siemens already owns the remaining 35 pct of Tel Plus. The
65 pct represenmts Telecom's principal operating asset.

all but 29 mln dlrs of the price at closing. Of this, 21 mln
dlrs was to be paid 11 months later and two mln dlrs per year
on the anniversary date of the transaction.

Frans Andriessen welcomed the agreement on details of dairy
output cuts over two years and promised new measures to help
farmers hurt by the drive to reduce EC surpluses.
    ""We are now in a favourable position to improve the
situation in the dairy sector,"" he told a news conference.
    The Commission will be able to proceed with a 3.2 billion
European Currency Unit plan to dispose of over a mln tonnes of
butter in EC stores, as the deal should prevent major new
stocks from accruing.
    A preliminary accord on the dairy package was reached in
December, but approval was held up by a row over Commission
proposals that it be given power to suspend sales of surplus
stocks into store.
    After 36 hours of negotiations, ministers agreed detailed
rules for such a suspension, allowing it only when new public
stocks of butter exceed 180,000 tonnes and when market prices
were sharply below those paid for sales into EC stores.
    Andriessen said the accord improves the atmosphere for what
he said are bound to be tough discussions on his proposals for
cuts in EC farm price cuts, notably in cereals, in the coming
season.
    The ministers also approved a three-year 350 mln Ecu
package of measures to help farmers in difficulty and pay
compensation to those who opt for less intensive production
methods. Andriessen said he regretted ministerial objections
had forced him to withdraw sections of this package, for which
he had originally earmarked 1.3 billion Ecus over five years.
    He said he would revise and resubmit plans to allow older
farmers to take early retirement, either taking their land out
of agricultural production or passing it to successors.
    The Commission is also working on proposals to enable the
EC and member states to provide direct income supports to
hard-pressed small farmers. Andriessen said he could not give
full details, but member state aid would be subject to ""strict

9170,MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES,"Middle East currency dealers meet in
Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their
business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from
the Arab world to London.
    The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association
also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf
currency system is more real that at any time this decade.
    Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these
issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to
be major talking points.
    About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --
including some in London and other major non-Arab financial
centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins
on on Saturday.
    Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a
growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,
by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in
London.
    The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks,
foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in
Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based
banks are boosting their treasury operations in London.
    As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade
finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain
ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.
Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.
    The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab
Banking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased
their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading
representative offices to branch status to allow dealing.
    One economist said: ""It is cheaper to run a riyal book in
London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...
There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.""
    Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit
taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,
&lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November
1986.
    The major market maker has traditionally been London-based
consortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom
joint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its
London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.
    One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: ""Inevitably the
volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new
licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most
of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.""
    Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi
riyal market is difficult to quantify.
    Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency
deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped
to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986
from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.
    The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal
trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very
quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now
staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect
&lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations.
    Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market
moving completely out of the region, partly because of local
demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian
Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate
internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue
speculation.
    There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market
shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain
and London is still limited.
    But for the first time since the formation of the six
nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs
that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.
    Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final
currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
    But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary
System style with a common peg have been discussed at high
level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected
to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.
    One dealer said: ""A lot of exposure is being given to
discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the
end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.""
    One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.
    The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated
since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently
linked to a basket of currencies while the other five
currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the
U.S. Dollar.
    Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation
against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,
but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of
7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.
    Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued
slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the
undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.

to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining
restrictions two weeks ago.
    Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown
of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of
hypothetical losses. Some of them are ""too sophisticated to
convert into financial terms,"" one banking source said.
    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is
impossible to calculate.
    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's
economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.
    ""Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-
achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only
contributed to largely internal, economic problems,"" one said.
    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured
Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation
for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under
martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was
originally devised several years ago by the Institute of
National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning
commission.
    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish
economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth
trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in
credits from Western commercial and government lenders.
    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was
booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing
the estimate as ""a theoretical projection based on a high point,
which has no real scientific evaluation.""
    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to
the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs
annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were
imposed.
    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to
200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade
surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs
against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.
    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important
U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,
chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits
dried up for economic not political reasons.  ""Poland is
accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for
political reasons,"" said one expert. ""It's an illusion based on a
misunderstanding of Western economy.""
    ""There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone
who has no hope of repaying it,"" another said, adding that
Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits
in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.
    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as ""nebulous,"" one
diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders
and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of
scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the
lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact
on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs
and lacks the means to modernise its industry.
    ""MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not
be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to
regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are
in play now,"" said one Western envoy.
    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their
quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist
measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper
Poland's efforts to regain entry.
    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised
this fact recently.
    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, ""Making
up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly
difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of
two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of
exports by only about 100 mln dlrs.""
    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it
has a ""moral right"" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says
imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said
""The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing
of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will
just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing
Solidarity.""
    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in
talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was
looking for a lead from the United States.
    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its
financial obligations to the United States, ""but not in a short
time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its
foreign economic partners.""
    He stressed that the U.S. ""had a particular opportunity to
play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners
interested in the settlement of Polish debt.""
    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed
Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and
Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and
said it should now play a more positive role.
    ""As a major superpower the United States can influence
international organisations,"" he said, citing recent meetings
aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to
which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

17356,SHULTZ SAYS U.S. WHEAT BONUS OFFER UP TO USDA,"U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz said it was up to the Agriculture Department to decide
whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union.
    Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a 
wheat bonus offer to the Soviet Union ""is something that I
basically leave to the Agriculture Department to figure out.""
    Last year, Shultz spoke out against President Reagan's
decision to offer subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union --
an offer Moscow spurned.
    ""I've always been a little put off by the idea that we would
arrange our food supplies so as to price them in such a way
that the Soviet housewife could buy American-produced food for
less than the American housewife could buy it,"" Shultz said.
    ""It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in world
markets, we have to meet the price,"" he added.
    Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteria
of USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S.
customers ""questionable.""
    An across-the-board EEP would mark a ""considerable change"" in
the current program, which Shultz said is designed ""to say to
other countries that subsidize, particularly the European
Common Market, that we're not going to give up our markets to
those subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag that
will meet that competition and hold our markets for our
farmers.""
    ""If you just go across-the-board and subsidize everything,
that's a different order of program and seems to me quite
questionable,"" he said.

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is seen as a test case by
the Soviet Union, which will probably demand to follow China, a
top European Community official said.
    Willy de Clercq, External Relations Commissioner of the
European Communities, told a news conference that China's
application would involve long and difficult negotiations.
    China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in
February presented a memorandum backing its application, which
De Clercq said was now being studied. Questions would then be
presented to China.
    ""After China, other important state-trading countries
including the Soviet Union, will probably demand accession.
China's application could be considered a test case,"" he said.
    He said the EC strongly backed China's application, but
others among GATT's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line.
    Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy
entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and
the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy
without trade discrimination, de Clercq added.
    De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese
economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia, the two current
Socialist GATT members.
    On China's import potential, he said a foreign exchange
shortage would force China to import less this year and next
than in the past, with an emphasis on technological equipment
and capital.
    During his visit, De Clercq has met top Chinese leaders and
today signed an agreement to open a European Community
Commission office in Peking.

18468,AUSTRALIAN ELECTION CAMPAIGN FOCUSSES ON TAX CUTS,"Treasurer Paul Keating said the
opposition's tax-cutting policy, a key issue in the run up to
the July 11 elections, was a miscalculation that would severely
damage the Australian economy.
    Opposition leader John Howard disputed Keating's
allegations. ""Keating is engaged in a desperate, last ditch
panic attempt to deny long-suffering Australian taxpayers the
cuts to which they are entitled,"" he said.
    Keating said in a radio interview that errors in Howard's
plan, including ""double counting,"" would increase the budget
deficit and could push interest rates above 20 pct.
    Keating said that Treasury officials who had studied
Howard's plans concluded that his proposed tax and spending
cuts would result in a nine billion dlr deficit and damage
international market confidence in Australia.
    In his mini-budget on May 13 Keating said the budget
deficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two and
three billion dlrs.
    Howard has said a conservative government under his
leadership would reduce the 55 pct top personal and company tax
level to 38 pct and fund the reduction by cutting government
spending.
    Keating and Prime Minister Bob Hawke have promised not to
increase taxes or impose new ones, but rejected any tax cuts.
Instead they called for wage and other economic restraints to
help overcome balance of payments and foreign debt problems.
    Inflation declined to 9.4 pct for the year to March 31 from
an annual 9.8 pct at the end of the December quarter.
    Hawke has said inflation would fall to six pct by the
middle of next year.

209,FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES,"France's right wing government is facing
growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising
down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation
forecasts for this year.
    Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector
forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation
estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its
economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a
2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last
september.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures
would not push the government off its chosen mix of price
deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.
    But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would
push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising
the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.
    And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed
Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth
and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,
perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential
elections due by April 1988.
    ""The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,""
said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. ""We have the
impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth
this year.""
    ""The big question is whether the government's policy of wage
moderation will be maintained,"" he added.
    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout
1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises
justified by increased productivity.
    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond
Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already
rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built
into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher
prices.
    Calling the government's policies ""unbalanced and unjust,"" he
also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He
announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the
government would spend two billion francs on a series of
measures to boost employment and training
    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate
Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac
earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of
France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings
its top priority.
    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and
still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts
said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.
    ""Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist
government and I dont think this administration is going to
reverse that,"" commented Michel Develle, economist at
recently-privatised Banque Paribas.
    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas
and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher
inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he
said.
    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more
than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7
per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.
    ""But that would still be an exceptional achievement
considering that for the first time since the Second World War
all french prices have been freed,"" he commented.
    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments
abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible
for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living
costs.
    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should
have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.
    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long
as the government kept wages under control.
    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of
1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more
than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,
INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,
he added.
    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to
help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget
deficit, several analysts said.
    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value
Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a
loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than
expected growth, they said.

8033,"ALBERTA BUDGET SETS TAX INCREASE, LOWER DEFICIT","The Alberta provincial
government will increase its general corporate tax rate on
April 1 to 15 pct from 11 pct under its 1987-88 budget
announced today, provincial treasurer Dick Johnston said.
    The budget forecasts the 1987-88 provincial deficit to be
1.90 billion dlrs, compared to a forecast deficit of 3.30
billion dlrs for fiscal 1987, which ends March 31, Johnston
said.
    The budget forecasts fiscal 1988 revenues of 8.63 billion
dlrs and expenditures of 10.42 billion dlrs, Johnston said.
    The provincial budget raises combined personal and
corporate income taxes by about 20 pct, Johnston said.
    Johnston told a news conference taxes were increased after
revenues from oil and gas taxes fell by 64 pct last year and
are not expected to increase sharply in the short term.
    The provincial government expects resource tax revenues for
fiscal 1987 to fall to 1.30 billion dlrs from a previously
estimated 2.20 billion dlrs, compared to 3.60 billion dlrs
collected in fiscal 1986 before the collapse in oil prices.
    Johnston told reporters he needed to raise taxes in order
to begin moving towards a balanced budget in 1990-91.
    Johnston said the personal income tax increase takes three
forms. The basic provincial tax rate rises to 46.5 pct from
43.5 pct of the basic federal income tax rate.
    The provincial budget also imposed a temporary eight pct
surtax on individuals with taxable income of more than 36,000
dlrs, he said.
    In addition, the government levied a flat one pct surtax on
all individuals with taxable income.
    Johnston said overall government spending of 10.42 billion
dlrs represents a cut of 4.4 pct, but various grants and tax
credits for agriculture and energy industries will remain.

refundable.

6576,GULF ARAB STATES MOVE TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION,"Finance and economy ministers of the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have ended talks
after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at
boosting economic integration.
    But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a
resolution on a common currency exchange rate system.
    The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed
Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that
the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank
governors for further discussion.
    He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed
denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were
asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance
ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia.
    Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to
discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new
system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit
conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year.
    The denominator approved by the governors has not been made
public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the
European Monetary System (EMS).
    Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC
citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state.
They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens
to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms.
    He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods
containing radiation caused by last year's Chernobyl nuclear
disaster in the Soviet Union, and agreed all products with
excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin.

1726,BANK OF CANADA MADE AGGRESSIVE USE OF T-BILLS,"The Canadian government's reduced
borrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make ""aggressive
use"" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of
financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report.
    The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, also
noted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs
at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in
January, 1986, and that the country's economy performed
unevenly while inflation remained a major concern.
    Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new
bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the
reliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly
more through short term treasury bill financings.
    ""The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant
that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances
and lower financing costs,"" said Bouey who was replaced by
deputy governor John Crow last month.
    The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was
69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the
year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.
    The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an
eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing
requirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, and
generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange
transactions.
    Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made
greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to
five year maturities, Bouey said.
    Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to
banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average
of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion
dlrs in March, 1986.
    The advances were made largely to four banks, Canadian
Commercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada and
the Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been
liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and
the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the
advances.

16607,KUWAITI DAILY SAYS OPEC CREDIBILITY AT STAKE,"OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutiny

production up 1.4 mln bpd,"" it warned OPEC's official prices
could face fresh pressure from international oil companies
seeking cheaper supplies.
    It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other
producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor
did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. 
   ""The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under
fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the
European and American markets,"" the daily said.
    The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in
March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some
members had raised output last week. It gave no details.
    ""Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was
able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and
producing over quotas has begun anew,"" it said.
    The sources warned that ""maybe the (price of a) barrel of
oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if
there is no control on supplies,"" it said.
    ""The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel
may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure
OPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,""
it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift
from Qatar unless it gave price discounts.

solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,""

sees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee
Organisation system of export quotas.
    Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president of
the Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful because
of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing-
nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britain
and the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london.
    Escalante told a news conference here he ""carried the weight
of the negotiations"" at the meeting by calling for larger export
quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.
    Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota
system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once
it has satisfied internal demand.
    ""There are countries such as our own whose sales
possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current
quotas,"" Escalante said.
    At the same time, there are countries favoured by the
current system that have been assigned quotas far above their
export potential, he said.
    The current ICO quota system is ""unfair and autocratic,""
Escalante said.
    Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee
prices over the last week to speculation rather than real
matters of supply and demand.

3869,BRAZIL'S SARNEY MEETS STRIKES WITH SHOW OF FORCE,"With troops in place in Brazil's
ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose
Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of
force.
    Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported
in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and
six areas of oil production.
    The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention
because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry
employees.
    The government had already dispatched more than 1,000
marines to occupy the country's main ports after a national
seamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday.
    The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day,
represents a stern challenge to the government.
    The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil
desperately needs foreign exchange.
    It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance which
precipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision on
February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
commercial debt.
    There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen's
strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most
important in South America -- and the country's other main
ports.
    Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on
the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military
presence here is generally discreet.
    A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are
out of sight.
    Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the
Docemarte, seamen's leaders said. After explaining to the
captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because
the strike was illegal, the men returned to work.
    One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said ""it is a
psychological war. They are using force and we are using
peaceful methods.""
    Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the
Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working.
    At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are
strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports.
    Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in
Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board
ships here were not running out of food.
    The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney's
civilian government since it came to power two years ago.
    Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of
farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank
interest rates.
    The current rash of labour unrest in industry and
agriculture stems from the failure of the government's
now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze.

considering a reverse stock split of at least one-for-10 and
expects to report a second-quarter profit, compared to a loss
last year.
    The stock consolidation ""is something we're discussing, but
it's not definite,"" Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner
told Reuters in an interview.
    A private placement recently brought the number of
outstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July
31, 1986, the fiscal yearend.
    ""The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,""
Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to apply
for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange.
    Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of
five pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs,
for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third
quarter should be about the same as the second, he added.
    Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195
dlrs in the second quarter.
    After ""a disastrous first quarter,"" Sand hopes to break even
in the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company has
scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the
33.5 mln dlrs projected in December.
    The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and
Canadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs,
or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs.
    In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost
1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585
dlrs.
    Shattner believes the company will post better results this
year due to several factors.
    ""Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying
products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi
in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the
second quarter,"" he said.
    Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computer
accessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancement
devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT> of
Japan.
    Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc,
is developing software that lets large maniframe computers
handle large databases and share them between applications.
    It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, which
is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major
corporations.
    The company has also reduced costs through some staff
cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff
instead of straight commissions, Shattner said.
    And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourth
fiscal quarter, Shattner said.

5472,BELGIAN GOVERNMENT TO CUT FINANCIAL REQUIREMENT,"Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried
Martens announced to Parliament a plan to reduce the 1987
government financing requirement by 20.6 billion francs.
    He said this will enable the requirement to be held to
419.7 billion francs, against the previous government target of
417.8 billion, or eight pct of gross national product.
    Martens said following a lowering of government estimates
of 1987 nominal GNP growth and a re-estimation by government
departments of 1987 spending, the government calculated that
unless action was taken, the requirement would exceed the
target by 22.5 billion francs.
    Martens said the plan involved raising non-fiscal receipts
by 5.8 billion francs and reducing spending by 14.3 billion.
The remaining 0.5 billion francs will be raised through
treasury operations.
    Martens said the money is being found through a series of
small economies and confirmed that it includes the raising of
two billion francs through the sale of part of the government's
50 pct holding in the gas company Distrigaz.
    Last year, the government announced a major program
designed to cut 1987 spending by 195 billion francs.
    The program was designed to get Belgium out of what the
government said was a ""snowball effect"" under which the
government constantly borrowed more to finance budget deficits
which were due largely to the cost of servicing and repaying
existing debt.
    In 1986, the government financing requirement is estimated

16423,U.S. AUTOWORKERS SET FOR TOUGH BARGAINING ROUND,"The United Automobile Workers Union,
UAW, is asking local leaders to back a renewed drive for higher
wages in upcoming bargaining with the car and other major
industries while acknowledging that futher job losses are
inevitable as traditional U.S. manufacturing shrinks.
    The UAW will begin bargaining this summer on new contracts
covering some 380,000 members at General Motors Corp, the
world's largest corporation, and nearly 110,000 members at Ford
Motor Co, the number two U.S. automaker.
    National UAW labor contracts at both companies expire at
midnight September 14.
    The union is expected to chose one of the companies as a
possible strike target in early September to concentrate its
efforts.
    UAW president Owen Bieber was loudly cheered by some 3,000
local delegates at a special bargaining strategy convention
yesterday when he declared the union is ready to go to ""war""
against the major auto makers in support of its goals.
    ""It takes two to make peace, but only one to make war ...
and if it's war, the UAW will be ready for it. War against the
insecurity of layoff,"" the UAW chief said.
    In a 101-page document proposing its 1987 collective
bargaining program, the leadership of the 1.1 mln member union
urged ""full resumption of our traditional wage formula"" as ""a
top priority in this round of bargaining.""
    But the union concedes that increased foreign competition,
new technology and shifts to low-cost offshore production by
U.S. manufacturers will continue to cut the number of workers
in the motor vehicle and agricultural equipment industries.
    Union leaders told Reuters the 1987 round of bargaining
with GM and Ford will be one of the most difficult in the
51-year history of the union in view of GM's announced goal to
close plants it deems non-competitive and to increase its
purchase of parts from outside suppliers as part of a massive
program to reduce its costs by 10 billion dlrs and reverse the
profits decline it suffered the last two years.
    At Ford, where a record 3.3 billion dlrs in profits last
year swelled its cash reserves past eight billion dlrs,
analysts say the company's healthy position could make it a
tempting target for the union in its drive to increase wages.
    Labor executives for both GM and Ford have said they will
oppose any attempt to return to annual general wage increases
that were dropped in 1982 when the Detroit-based industry was
mired in a deep recession.
    But the UAW, pointing to a three pct pay increase to be
implemented later this year in the contract it negotiated with
Chrysler Corp after a 1985 strike, said it intends to seek full
reinstatement of annual percentage wage increases in this
year's bargaining with GM and Ford.

372,PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH>,"New Jersey-based overnight messenger
Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for
about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.
    Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for
some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a
takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from
another courier company.
    Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group
Inc, will be majority owner of the company.
    Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is
paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock
in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares
will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a
subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.
courier operations.
    If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders
would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in
debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC
Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.
    Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC
Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued
the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
    Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.
While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
    This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed
recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for
170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
    Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure
caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the
firm is reviewing its options on Stant.
    Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
    E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
complete the transaction. This so-called ""bridge"" financing
will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to
keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.
    ""Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the
management is turning around. We belive it will be a very
serious competitor in the future,"" said Idsal.
    William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier
division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.
    The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two
thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to
the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.
    The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from
the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire
20 business days after commencement unless extended.
